Don’t Blunder When You Hear Thunder

-- As the weather gets warmer, it’s a great time to start planning for thunderstorms and other severe weather. Facilities Operations and Development’s Environmental Health and Safety reminds everyone to prepare by having flashlights and batteries on hand. If you encounter a thunderstorm or other severe weather, be sure to seek shelter. If you can’t get inside, be sure to stay in your vehicle.

Zika virus — Know before you go

-- If you are planning travel to a Zika-affected area, plan ahead to take proactive steps to keep yourself and others healthy. Ohio State, in partnership with Columbus Public Health and other local and state partners, is providing information and guidance for students, faculty and staff. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women should avoid travel to Zika-affected areas, or if travel cannot be avoided, they should contact their physicians upon return to get tested for the virus. Women who are planning to become pregnant and their male partners should talk to their health care providers before traveling. All travelers should take maximum precautions to avoid mosquito bites and to practice safe sex.

********** MESSAGE FROM VP FOR STUDENT LIFE “DR. J”

-- The end of each semester is always among the busiest times on campus. Papers are due, group projects are coming together and exams are about to start. That is why Reading Day is this Tuesday to help you prepare, mentally and physically, for this time of year. The concept of Reading Day dates back to Ohio State’s transition from quarters to semesters. Under quarters, there was always a weekend between the last day of classes and the first final exam. But under the semester calendar, that natural break was lost. Student input was instrumental in developing a new approach. The solution was Reading Day, scheduled each semester on the day after classes end and the day before exams begin. It was designed to give students the opportunity to refresh, refuel and concentrate on exams once classes were over. The first Reading Day was in December, 2012 and it has been a fixture on the academic calendar ever since.
