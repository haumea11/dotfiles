Unless you visit any member page of freedns.afraid.org while

considered dormant.  "Dormant" consists of unloading any stale
DNS records from memory which you may have set up in the past.
 This is a courtesy reminder.

Users supporting freedns.afraid.org with a premium plan of any
size are not affected.
