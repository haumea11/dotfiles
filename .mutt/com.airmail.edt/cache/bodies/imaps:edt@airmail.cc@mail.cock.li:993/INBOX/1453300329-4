Preface: I'm sorry to those that were previously unsubscribed from this
list. I had to resubscribe all users as the mailing list database was
lost in the second raid. Unsubscription instructions are at the bottom
of this E-mail.

Hi Cock.li,

We have a lot to talk about, so I will try to be succinct.

1. Cock.li's second hard drive has been stolen, uh I mean "confiscated"
by the German government. This means that all the data is gone until I
get the HDD back, but the service has been restored from a user database
backup. This is why all of your E-mails went missing. This situation is
ongoing and I am still trying to find out what happened and why. Any
updates will be posted to my Twitter <https://twitter.com/gexcolo>

Here are some news articles chronicling what happened:

r-message-sent-from-8chans-e-mail-host-cock-li/

> http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/cock-li-server-seized-again-=
by-german-prosecutor-service-moves-to-iceland/

2. Cock.li has moved to a new host, Flokinet <https://flokinet.is/>. I
purchased a used server from them and new hard drives and am now
colocating in their Bucharest datacenter. Flokinet is a
privacy-conscious host that has proven they will advocate for the
privacy of their customers, and I've met with the CEO personally and
discussed cock.li's situation with him.

3. This new server was 880 EUR. The hard drives were 188 EUR. Server
setup was 75 EUR. This has put a huge financial strain on cock.li and
while the site received almost $1000 last month, it still leaves cock.li
$250 in the hole as of this month. If you have any money to spare,
please *please* donate so that cock.li will continue to be a waste of my
time, not my money. Donate here: <https://cock.li/donate>. Reminder that
cock.li operates not-for-profit, meaning no matter what I do not profit
off of donations in any way.

4. Registration is closed for all of cock.li's old domains until I get
the HDD back or figure something else out. The good news is that cock.li
has 6 new domains on which registration is open! They are: cock.lu,
cock.email, aaathats3as.com, hitler.rocks, firemail.cc, and
getbackinthe.kitchen. You can register them here:
<https://cock.li/auth/register>. Speaking of...

5. Cock.li's new site is live!!! I first started on this revision over a
year ago, but I've been distracted from finishing it and pushing it
live. Recent events have motivated me to finish the site and deploy it.
At least something good came out of this!

Thanks to everyone for your amazing support through all of this. With
all of us, cock.li will never die. The phallic reich will reign for a
thousand years.

I'll leave you with this quote from /int/:
> japan different from many,
> but all mankind share one thing=20
> love for dick. through dick,unity.

Love,

    Vincent Canfield
