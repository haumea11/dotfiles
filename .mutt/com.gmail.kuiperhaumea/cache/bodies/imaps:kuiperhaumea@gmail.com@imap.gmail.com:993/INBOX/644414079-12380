   Dear JOHN,

   I sincerely hope you are considering PrattMWP College of Art and
   Design, Pratt Institute=E2=80=99s upstate New York extension campus in
   Utica, as a prospective college choice based on your interest in
   art, design or a similar field. If you haven't visited our
   beautiful upstate New York campus, join us this summer for one of
   our upcoming information sessions.  The next one is August 21 from
   1-4, and it  includes a presentation about our majors (listed
   below), portfolio and admissions requirements, campus tours, and an
   optional portfolio review with an admissions counselor.  To
   schedule,  email admissions@mwpai.edu, call 800.755.8920 or
   [1]REGISTER ONLINE NOW.

   PrattMWP is ranked among the top design schools in the United
   States by Graphic Design USA, and Pratt Institute is ranked among
   the top design schools by BusinessWeek and recently ranked number
   one for fine arts and studio programs by USA Today.

   [2]REQUEST A CATALOG NOW!

   How Does a PrattMWP Education Work?
   Pratt Institute offers you the option of starting your Pratt degree
   at PrattMWP and then finishing your degree at Pratt's main campus
   in Brooklyn. PrattMWP offers the first two years of Pratt's
   renowned BFA programs in:

   [3]Communications Design (graphic design, advertising art
   direction, or illustration),
   [4]Fine Arts (painting, drawing, ceramics, sculpture, jewelry,
   printmaking),
   [5]Art and Design Education (teacher prep/certification),
   [6]Photography
   Undecided Art and Design

   After you complete the first two years at PrattMWP in Utica, you
   may seamlessly and automatically relocate to Pratt=E2=80=99s main campus=
 in
   Brooklyn as  a junior to complete the last two years of your
   degree; no application is required to relocate. Starting your
   degree at PrattMWP provides you with the same prestigious education
   you would receive at Pratt's main campus.

   Although the vast majority of students relocate to Brooklyn to
   finish their degree, you also have the option to apply as a
   transfer student to any other art and design school after the first
   two years.

   Why do Students Choose PrattMWP?

   1. Outstanding Rankings and Reputation:

   Communications Design was ranked among the "Top 10 Graphic Design
   and Fashion Design Programs" by [7]College Crunch
   Fine Arts is ranked number one by USA Today.
   PayScale ranks Pratt number one among the best art and design
   schools with respect to the mid-career salary of its graduates
   USA Today ranks Pratt number one for fine arts and studio programs
   Pratt is ranked among the top design schools by BusinessWeek
   Graphic Design USA ranks PrattMWP among the top design schools in
   the United States

   2. Automatic Relocation to Brooklyn in Year Three: the transition
   to Brooklyn in year three is automatic and seamless as long as you
   are in good academic standing.  You will complete your degree in
   two years as long as you remain in the same major.  Upon
   graduation, you are awarded your degree by Pratt Institute.

   3. A Professional Faculty and An Intimate and Nurturing
   Environment: PrattMWP's beautiful 11-acre campus is located in
   Utica, New York, a small city near six million acres of protected
   Adirondack wilderness.  PrattMWP is ideal for students looking for
   a quieter, more intimate environment for the first two years where
   they can focus on their work and learn from a faculty of
   professional artists and designers.  The student to teacher ratio
   is 10 to 1, ensuring individualized attention in every class.

   Generous Merit-Based Scholarships and Significantly Lower Tuition:
   all students are automatically considered for scholarships, which
   range up to half tuition, with no separate application required.
   Tuition is also substantially less than most top art and design
   schools.

   Applying: the non-binding freshman early action deadline is
   November 1.  The regular decision deadline is January 5. [8] View
   admissions requirements.

   JOHN, I look forward to seeing you and hope you will
   consider PrattMWP on your short list of prospective colleges.  Get
   started now and [9]request information or [10]schedule a campus
   visit.

   Sincerely yours,


   Ken Marchione
   Dean of Art and Design
