John -

We just got word that we won our 19th state, taking the majority of the =
delegates in today's primary in West Virginia.

Every vote we earn and every delegate we secure sends an unmistakable =
message about the values we share, the country's support for the ideas of =
our campaign, and a rejection of Donald Trump and his values.

Now we're on to two more primaries next week in Kentucky and Oregon, where =
we also hope to do very well. So let's keep going.

Add one more $5 contribution to our campaign and we can win Kentucky and =
Oregon next week and send a powerful message that we'll fight for our =
values all the way up to the Democratic convention:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia-win?refcode=3Dem1=
60510

There is nothing I would like more than to take on and defeat Donald =
Trump, someone who must never become president of this country. But I =
believe that it is not enough to just reject Trump - this is an =
opportunity to define a progressive vision for America. Voters agree: just =
today, three new polls showed that we are the best campaign to defeat =
Trump.

We fully acknowledge we have an uphill climb ahead of us, but we're used =
to that. We have been fighting uphill from the day this campaign began, =
and we're going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast. And with =
your help, I hope to take on Trump, too. Thank you for standing with me.

Add another $5 contribution to our campaign now:

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders
