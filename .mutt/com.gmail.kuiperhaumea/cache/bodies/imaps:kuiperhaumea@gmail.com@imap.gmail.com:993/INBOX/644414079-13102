Ok so its 10 am to 12 pm with a break halfway through. There's all you can
eat free pizza afterwards as well. The location is 1934 N. 4th Street, and
my dad and I can give you a ride if you want just so its easier for you.
The whole thing costs two dollars, which I'd be more than happy to pay if
you don't want to. I think I mentioned this before but the topic is listed
as "Can we trust the Bible?" and it says it will focus mostly on the
reports of Jesus, especially the report of his return from the dead. Hope
you can come!
