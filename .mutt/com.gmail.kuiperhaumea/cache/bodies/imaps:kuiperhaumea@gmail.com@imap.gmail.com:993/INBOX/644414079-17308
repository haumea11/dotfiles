Hello John,

I do hope all is going well and you are looking forward to the next show.

I think you'd make a great cast member and I would love to have you on cast=
.=20

Typically we do a 3 show trial run to make it official and see if we are go=
od fit for you and you are a good fit for us. However, we have dropped a fe=
w people and I want to fill our cast with those who have Rocky Horror in th=
eir hearts and I feel this is you.

There a few things I want to touch bases on and ensure you are good with al=
l this.

We do a lot of our cast communication on Facebook, from cast discussions, s=
how information, thoughts, ideas, important information. I would suggest yo=
u make it a habit on checking facebook when ever possible, (at least for th=
e group)

It is a secret group that I can add you to, that way you can get notificati=
ons and take an active part in cast discussion and receive cast information=
.

As you know, our shows are typically the 1st Saturday of the month unless s=
omething is happening at the theater in which we have to move it back like =
 around Halloween time.  We always let everyone know well in advance to mak=
e plans.

The entire cast attends a meeting at 8pm (unless it is noted to make an ear=
lier or later time) at Cora's house prior to the show on the Show night.  H=
ere we discuss important information, issues, fun events and we do workshop=
s and team building activates.  We also cast the next show at the meeting. =
This also gives everyone a chance to mingle and great ready for the show if=
 they need to.

I would like you to begin attending cast meetings on show nights.
Cora's address is:

3806 Edendale Road
Columbus, OH 43207

Some people think that what we do as a shadowcast is a simple and quick eve=
nt.  As you saw the other night, it's not that easy and it's almost like a =
stage show. Lots is always going on. There for, I ask for dedication from m=
y cast....from making sure you are meetings, shows, taking an active part i=
n the cast in all aspects.=20

If at any time you feel there is problem or a concern, you can contact me a=
ny time,  I am always available on call, text or facebook.

My Assistant Cast Director Katy is also available if you can't get in touch=
 with me.

Sometimes, bad things happen in life or things don't go as we planed.  If f=
or any reason you can't make a meeting or show or both, be sure to contact =
me and Katy as soon as possible.  Text us both or send a personal message o=
n facebook.


All Rocky Horror characters have 2 cast members that alternate the role. So=
me roles are Full (such as Frank, Brad, Mags, Columbia) however, this does =
not mean you may not get an opportunity to play a character.  =20

Sometimes, an opening may become available and this would give you the oppo=
rtunity to play a character you don't normally play.  To play a character, =
a cast member is required to have that Character costume before playing the=
 role. There a few smaller added costume pieces that have like Frank's cape=
, Columbia's ears.

I think this covers the important stuff at the moment.
Add me to facebook as soon as posible
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
See you on April 2nd at Cora's.

Huggzz and Kizzez
