John -

The corporate media have always treated this race as if it was over. The =
political establishment hopes we'll all just fall in line. But if you're =
looking for a sign that the Clinton campaign knows this primary is far =
from finished, here it is:

"Clinton back on the air with TV ads" - Politico, May 9, 2016

The article concludes with this line, "Clinton's campaign is eager to stop =
Sanders from gaining momentum with a string of victories through May." But =
here's the truth: there is no stopping a set of ideas whose time has come, =
no matter how many ads they run.

West Virginia votes today. Oregon and Kentucky hold their primaries in one =
week. It's been a pretty crazy election, and I know that if we continue to =
stand together, anything is possible.

Add another $5 contribution to our campaign today and we are going to do =
very well in West Virginia, Oregon, and Kentucky. From there it's on to =
California, New Jersey and the rest of the June 7th states, where there is =
so much at stake.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/every-last-vote

Last week's victory in Indiana was a tremendous surprise to the corporate =
media and political establishment. Hopefully we'll enjoy the same result =
later tonight in West Virginia and in Oregon and Kentucky next week. =
Bernie's working hard, the staff and volunteers are doing the same. The =
rest is up to all of us.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager
