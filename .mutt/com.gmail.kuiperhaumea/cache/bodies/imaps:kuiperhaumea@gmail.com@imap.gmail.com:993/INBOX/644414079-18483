John -

A whopping total of 694 pledged delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday, and =
-- especially given the latest polling out of California -- we believe we =
have a good chance of winning a big majority of them. But we need your =
help to do that.

Thousands of in-state volunteers are hitting the streets in these final =
days to find Bernie voters and get them to the polls. But they just can't =
knock the door of every voter we need to contact.

So our task this weekend is pretty simple: call every single Bernie =
supporter we can in the upcoming states, and make sure they have a plan to =
vote on Tuesday. Can Bernie count on you to volunteer a couple hours of =
your time?

YES, I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS THIS WEEKEND:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=3Dem=
160603

If you've never called voters for Bernie before, now is the time to take =
the plunge. Calling on our Bernie Dialer is easy; you just need a computer =
or a tablet, and a phone. We provide a simple script for you to follow, =
connect you directly to the targeted voters, and we have dedicated =
volunteers standing by on livechat to help out if you run into any =
problems.

 Our plan is to go into the Democratic convention in Philadelphia with as =
many votes, delegates and states as possible. From there, the =
superdelegates will have to consider who is the best candidate to take on =
Donald Trump - and the polls consistently show Bernie is that candidate.

So don't let this opportunity slip by. Our collective efforts this weekend =
have the potential to shock the political establishment and show the =
billionaire class that we've had enough of super-PAC-funded politics as =
usual. Your involvement will help write a pivotal chapter in American =
political history, so we're asking you to step up and commit as much =
volunteer time as you can.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. If you'd like to learn more about our weekend of action and the =
importance of these June 7th contests, please join us on a special =
livestream event tonight (Friday) at 9 pm ET/6 pm PT: =
