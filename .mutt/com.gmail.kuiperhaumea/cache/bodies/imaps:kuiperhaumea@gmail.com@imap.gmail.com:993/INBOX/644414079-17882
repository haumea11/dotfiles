John -

Over the past few days, Hillary Clinton's campaign and some of its top =
supporters have launched an odd new line of attack against people like you =
who stand with Bernie. They are saying that by continuing to campaign and =
fight for every vote, for every delegate, that we are helping Donald =
Trump.

They've used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are =
"giving aid and comfort" to Trump. They are emailing supporters with the =
subject line "What Trump loves about Bernie."

Let me be clear, there is one candidate in this Democratic primary who =
Donald Trump said would make a "great president," and it's not Bernie =
Sanders.

Bernie is going to fight through the narrow path we have to the nomination =
because there is also only one candidate who believes health care should =
be a right for everyone in this country, that kids of all backgrounds =
should be able to go to college without crushing debt, and that we cannot =
transform a corrupt system by taking its money.

Can Bernie count on you to contribute $5 to our campaign right now as a =
way of saying you are still with Bernie Sanders and believe that every =
vote and every delegate is an important declaration of support for the =
values we share?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/values-we-share

Here's the truth: no matter what the Clinton campaign says, there is one =
candidate in this race Donald Trump said would make a great president, and =
another that he would never want to face in November.

And that's because poll after poll after poll shows that he wouldn't stand =
a chance against our political revolution.

So we are going to keep fighting hard for every vote and for every =
delegate. Not just because that's the only way to win this nomination, but =
because we believe the power of our progressive agenda would energize the =
kind of high voter turnout needed to stop Trump. That's why we have to =
ask:

Can Bernie count on you to contribute $5 to our campaign right now as a =
way of saying you are still with Bernie Sanders and believe that every =
vote and every delegate is an important declaration of support for the =
values we share?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/values-we-share

People are voting in five primaries today. In just four days, we'll close =
the books on another important FEC fundraising deadline. Everyone's going =
to be watching to see if people are willing to fight for Bernie, and for =
the political revolution. Let's show them we are.

In solidarity,
