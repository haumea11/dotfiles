Sounds good thanks! I've read about pgp before, I'm actually messing around
with low-level encryption algorithms and stuff for fun .

I also haven't figured out exactly how to transfer my system to a new hard

Also, I assume you're running arch on the Pi? And did you manage to find a
terabyte sd card for it yet?
