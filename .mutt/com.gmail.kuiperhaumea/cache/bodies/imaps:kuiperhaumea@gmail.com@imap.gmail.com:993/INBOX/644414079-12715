Hey John. I sent you a text but I'm not sure you got it. I thought I would
send the same message via email to make sure you get it. I remember
discussing with you last year your objections to Christianity, and you said
that one of your biggest ones is the problem of evil. This Saturday my
church is offering a class that will explain this issue in depth. If you
are interested in learning more about how this paradox can be resolved or
in discussing it more this is a great opportunity to do so.  Plus
afterwards they have all the free pizza you could want (not crappy pizza
too).  Let me know if you're interested and I'll give you more details.
