Hey Louise,

Don't worry about a few days here or there.  I'm pretty busy myself as
of late (and it only seems like it'll get more intense from here) so I
can certainly sympathise.

I'm looking forward to college.  You may wish you had the American
experience, but you're glad you don't have the American price.  It
costs an exorbitant amount of money to go to college most places here,
when it should be free.  We have some backward priorities.

It's good to hear you like Momo.  I've thought of naming my computer
(and guitars, and other possessions) but I never seem to come up with
anything.

Recommendations for music, let's see...  I have a few songs worth your
time, and if you like them you may like their artists.  "Trains" by
Porcupine Tree is a fantastic song, as is "Cut to Black" by Lemaitre
(named for the scientist, but at some point they dropped the
circonflexe in the band name.)  For (more) electronic stuff I like
Justice ("New Lands" and "Helix" come to mind) and Zero 7 (I love so
much of their work but a good place to start would be "Salt Water
Sound.")  If you like Zero 7, then Air and Skyhill are further
listening worth your time.

Also, if you're looking for weirder stuff, Swans' album "To Be Kind"
is a great album, if a bit hard to get used to for most listeners.

I'll stop with the music recommendations before I get too carried
away.

I don't know much of anything about Lyon, I hope you had a good time
there with your friends.  I'll have to make a note to look it up,
since I think it's a nice thing to know about the places in the world.

Let's see, interesting stories.  Let me quote you one from another
e-mail I recently sent (Context is that I'm no longer dating the girl
mentioned in the story.)

Hopefully the formatting on that went alright.  If that poses an
issue, I can just as easily drop the quotation formatting.  I always
write these e-mails in plaintext, so I never know how they'll look in
a non-monospaced font in a different mailclient.  Programmers are
pretty specific about their computer setup, and I guess in some sense
I'm a bit of a programmer.

The people at my school (at least, the ones I associate with anymore,
I can give details on what I mean if you especially fancy hearing
about stupid teenager drama that happened a year ago and doesn't even
matter anymore) are pretty cool.  The people I generally hang around
with like computers, theatre, singing, or some combination of those.
There are exceptions, but it's often very easy to become friends with
people you share interests with.  I'm glad to have the friends I have.

Well, how about you?  Do you have an interesting story to tell me?  I
might have a fresher one next time, but I can't promise anything.  I
would include another story here but if I did so it might slow me down
in sending this e-mail.

Are you involved in anything musically?  That is to say, singing or
playing an instrument.

Do you have a favorite color?  I'm pretty sure I haven't asked it yet
and I like to include a silly question from time to time.

Anyway, I'd best be off before it gets terribly late.  I have school
tomorrow, and I'm beginning to get tired.

Best Wishes,
John Markiewicz
