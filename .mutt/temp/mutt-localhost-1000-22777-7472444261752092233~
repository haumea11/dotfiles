I would like to introduce you to Joyce Peoples, Director of Human Resources for Wallick.  Joyce is copied this message.  As part of this process, we would like you to interview with someone from our Human Resources Team and with Brandon Carter, the hiring manager.  Joyce and I are meeting today to discuss schedules.  We will send you some times.  I understand you have a lot going on, so we will make sure we find something that works with both our schedules.  Thanks.
