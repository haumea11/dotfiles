Hey Mr. Medley,

You did not.  Was yesterday one of the four lessons I had paid for in
advance, or was it not?  I don't think it was, so I'll get you payment
for that.

As far as the quartet goes, we will likely be holding auditions within
a week or so.  Any projects you're interested in hiring us for, I'd be
glad to know details (time, place, what pieces or types of pieces we
should learn, etc.) and I'll talk it over with the quartet.
