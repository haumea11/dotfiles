Well, I had thought I responded to this e-mail, but I must not have.
Really sorry about that.

Let's see.  For TV shows (I'll admit, I don't watch terribly many) I tend
to watch a lot of anime.  Off the top of my head I also enjoyed Archer and
Louie C.K.'s show.  I enjoy quite a few, but I mostly watch TV in passing
rather than as a focused event these days.

As far as books go, I recently read "Left to Tell," which was good if a bit
heavy on the religion at some points, and will soon be starting Beowulf for
school.  There are also a couple less interesting titles on Systems
Administration I'm reading through these days.

Perhaps college either here in the states or Germany, then.  Regardless, I
really need to visit you guys.  I had taken a little French last year
(though the teacher was kind of terrible) but have moved since to picking
up the language on my own, so that may be useful.  I'm still not terribly
good, as you would quickly realize if I had to write a passage without a
French-English dictionary handy.

Since there was such an unintentional gap between the letters, I suppose
I'll do a recap of what happened over the summer.  I did very little, and
came to terms with another year of high school.  I don't especially fancy
High School, and have hopes that College will be at the very least more
interesting.  

The scattering of the ashes went well.  I suppose having a ceremony around
it seems a little contrary to how Mike would have gone about it, but I
think the whole thing was more for the survivors than anything else, and
the trip was fairly nice.  We were glad to have Liz and Baz, who are always
really chill.  We were sad you and Sophie couldn't be at the thing in Maine
(or at least, I was.  I didn't go around polling people.)  

Anyway, now my final year of High school has started.  I'm taking a tough
courseload this year, but I think I can handle it.  It's not as though the
American school system teaches anything difficult in high school, it's
simply a matter of how much of the stuff you're dealing with at once.

Anything interesting happen in your life during that gap?

Best Wishes,
John

P.S. I really am sorry about the gap, I didn't mean to leave this hanging
like that.
