Dear Dr. Rinehart,

To begin: I'm very excited to be a part of the school of music at Ohio
State!  It's nice to be moving on from high school to an environment
where I can pursue the fields about which I'm passionate more directly.

Since you're my academic advisor, I figure it would be best to ask you
about double majoring.  I would like to double major in music and
computer science (specifically your BA-CIS program).  I've taken AP
tests and will most likely be dodging my Calc and English
requirements.

When I go in to schedule my classes, what should I plan to do?  Any
advice pertaining to double majoring?  Anyone else I should also speak
with?

Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to being a part of
the community at OSU.

Best Wishes,
John Markiewicz
