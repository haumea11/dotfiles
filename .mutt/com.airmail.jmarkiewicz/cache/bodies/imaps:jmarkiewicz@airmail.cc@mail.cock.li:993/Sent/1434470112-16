Hey Sophie,

Don't worry too much about the response being a little later than
average.  I can certainly understand having less time surrounding tests,
as I think everyone who's gone through schooling knows things get
stressful around big tests.  It's good to hear it went well.

Welcome to the break experience.  It's awesome.  I do hope to see you at
the next family reunion if I can't make it over to France before then.

If you want to hear what a Daft Punk concert sounded like a while back,
Alive 2007 is a fantastic album.  As far as my music tastes go, I tend
to like some pretty weird stuff, but aside from Swans most of what I
listed there should be fairly listenable.  Swans is a good band, but
they're a little less "accessible" (whatever that means.)  Some of the
music I listen to took a while before I really started enjoying it.

It's good you approve of my hobbies.  I would be disappointed in you if
you had not, and I might have had to stop talking to you faster than you
would have stopped talking to me (I, too, am kidding.)

As far as video games, I play mostly old games and PC games.  PC games
worth giving a try: Team Fortress 2 (it's free, online, and will
probably run ok on any computer you can run minecraft well on,) DoTA 2
(really involved strategy game, also free, a lot of fun once you learn
the mechanics,) Borderlands 2 (costs money and probably won't run on
your PC unless it's a gaming rig of some sort, but is also available on
the PS3 and is a lot of fun.)  You can also install something known as
an emulator, which will use your PC to play old console games.  ZSNES is
an example, you can use it to play old Super Nintendo games.  Honorable
mentions go out to the Touhou Project games, which are a little trickier
to get and very difficult but I love them dearly.

Oh yeah, also Cave Story.  The original is free to download, will run on
anything, and is an amazing game.  Absolutely worth your time if you
want to get a little more involved in video games.

I'm sure I'll come up with more game recommendations, though I haven't
played nearly as many games in the past 12 months or so as I usually
would have.

Are there any good computer science programs in France (that you know
of?)  I'm looking into studying in places that aren't the US right now
because our education is pretty damn expensive.  My parents are willing
to throw (some) money at the problem whether it's put toward living
expenses or tuition, and I think it would be cool to study in another
country.  I can do research through other means, but I'm curious to see
your knowledge/thoughts on the subject.

Feel free to attach any ideas you had for conversation onto the end of
any response you may have to this e-mail.

Best Wishes,
John
