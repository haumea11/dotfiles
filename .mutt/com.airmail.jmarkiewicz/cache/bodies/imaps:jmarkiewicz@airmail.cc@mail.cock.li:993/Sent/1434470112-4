Hey Sophie,

I'm good.  I think I'm supposed to write e-mails like they're letters,
but I haven't written letters much.  It's an old-fashioned art.  Hell,
even e-mail is kind of old-fashioned these days.

Lately, I've gotten very into computers.  I plan to eventually get a
career in computer science.  Something about the subject is really fun,
and there's a bit of money to be had in the field.  Ideally, I'll have
my own proper mailserver with a custom domain soon, so I may be moving
from e-mail to e-mail again within the next few months.  I'll end up
maintaining all my previous addresses, of course, but I always have one
I prefer to give people.

Summer has been treating me well, too.  I've mostly been sleeping.
Break is always nice for that.  Good coffee, good food, all that sort of
stuff.  I might be speaking at a conference later this Summer, which
would be cool.

Aussi, je parle franÃ§ais, mais juste un peu.  In fact, I speak such
little french that I probably butchered that sentence (google translate
thinks I did a fine job.)  I took a course in it this past year, but it
was frightfully slow.  I could have skipped the second level (learning
it myself) and then moved on to the third level, but my parents said I
should probably just drop it.  I'll self-study instead if I care to keep
learning the language.  I suppose after I understand the language a bit
better I could try writing letters in it.  That may end up just being a
bit funny.

But I think I'm getting carried away here with the e-mail.  How are you
doing lately?

Best Wishes,
John Markiewicz
