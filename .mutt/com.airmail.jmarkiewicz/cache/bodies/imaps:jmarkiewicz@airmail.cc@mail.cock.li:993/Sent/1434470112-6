Hey Sophie,

To preface: I've been traveling, so this is a little later than I would
have liked.  Sincerest apologies.

I only got an idea of what I want to do as a career within about the
last 6 months.  Up to that point, I was completely clueless about it,
because before I figured out how much I like working with computers it
seemed like anything I was passionate about made next to no money.
Studying abroad seems like a lot of fun and a good way to learn a whole
lot more about a place than you can pretty much any other way.

All of your potential fields of study are fields I respect, certainly.
Being a teacher in a third world country is very noble and I'm sure
would be rewarding in its own way, but I don't think I could be a teacher.

Also, don't worry too much about not knowing what you want to do.
You'll figure it out at some point here, I imagine.

Sorry about your luck, still having testing to deal with.  Does your
holiday at least run later than ours, or something?  Best of luck
dealing with the test, I'm sure you'll do well.  I understand the way
studying gets away from you, it tends to do the same for me.  Even if I
have no excuse to go out.  We certainly would have enjoyed seeing you.

At the conference I would be speaking about text analytics with the
python progrmming language.  It's not the most exciting, but the
exposure would be good and it would be fantastic on a resume.  That and
I do like the language.

That sentence alone required me to look up a couple of words, so a
letter might take a bit to compose.  I'll give it a try sometime.  Maybe
after another few letters, you'll get a letter in your own language out
of the blue or something.  Maybe not.  Depends how poorly my attempt
goes, I would guess.

Most days you don't feel like being social?  Just a lack of motivation,
or is something the matter?  Not to pry if something is, of course, and
not assuming something is.

Music is always fun.  I'm involved in my school's choir and I play
guitar as a hobby, so I share the love of music.  What sort of
percussion do you play?  On the subject of music, do you have any bands
worth listening to that you would care to recommend to me?  Language and
country of origin aren't particularly important, but if you recommend
french bands I'm less likely to know them.

If you ever want an ear to talk about drama to, I'm certainly fine with
that.  I understand, though, it may be a bit troublesome to try and give
me enough background to understand it.  I pretty recently was involved
in some drama, but at this point I'm through dealing with the people who
caused it in my life.

After I graduate high school (and that day can not come soon enough) I
plan to study at the Ohio State University.  It's one of the few places
I can get by without taking on any debt, and they have a pretty great
Computer Science program.  I think it will be pretty nice, and few
places (at least, in the states) are as inexpensive to live as Columbus
is without being much less nice.

What sort of hobbies do you have?  I know you play percussion, and your
mother mentioned you see a lot of live music, but is there anything else?

I, too, am very glad we're staying in contact.
Send my regards to the portion of your family who I'm not currently in a
house with.

John
