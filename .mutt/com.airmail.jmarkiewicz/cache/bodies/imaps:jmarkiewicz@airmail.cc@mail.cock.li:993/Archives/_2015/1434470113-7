Hey John,

Wow, you seem to have a precise plan about what you want to do, that's aweso=
me!
And I agree, computers are really interesting, I understand the appeal.
I myself am torn between choosing to study medicine, law, political science=20=

or some kind of engineering (preferably aeronautical engineering if it's the=
 path I choose to follow).
What I do know though is that I would very much like to travel and study abr=
oad,
in the US, Canada, the UK or even Australia or New Zealand if my mom ever le=
ts me go that far
away, which is highly doubtful. Otherwise being a teacher in a third world c=
ountry would also
be a very rewarding career choice.

I'm looking at the size of the paragraph I just wrote and I'm starting to re=
alize=20
I should start getting my shit together (pardon my language).

Oh right you're on Holliday! You're so lucky, I still have a French oral exa=
mination to pass=20
for the Baccalaur=C3=A9at. That's actually one of the reasons I'm not with m=
y mom and Baz.
It's really too bad, I would have enjoyed seeing the whole family.

What might you be speaking about at the conference?

And your sentence is perfect, google translate is right about the accuracy o=
f your French.
If you do decide to keep on studying it and start writing letters in it,
don't hesitate to send me some!

So anyway, lately I've been trying to study for my oral examination (which i=
s on Friday the third),
and I've failed, being tempted to go out and read and watch movies instead.
But I won't lie to you, most days I don't feel like being social so there is=
n't much going out.
I've also been playing music, I don't know if I've mentioned it before but I=
 play percussion,
and I've been practicing with the orchestra for our upcoming concert, but th=
e parts I play
aren't that challenging so it's not stressful, which is a relief.=20
I think that's about all that's been going on lately with me lately, I won't=
 bother you with any
of my high school drama, it wouldn't make any sense to you anyway.

I'm sorry if the thoughts I express in this e-mail are a little scattered,
I'm not a very organized person...

So where do you want to study after graduation?

I'm very glad we're staying in contact!
Send my love to your parents too,
Sophie.=20
