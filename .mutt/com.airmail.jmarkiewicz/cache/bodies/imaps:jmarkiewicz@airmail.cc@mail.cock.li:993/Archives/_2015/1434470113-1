Hello,

I feel like I need to have an introductory email so users feel warm and
fuzzy when they register for email service. I don't really know why this
is important.

If you have any trouble, I'm the one and only admin, and I can be
reached at vc@cock.li. My PGP id is 71A5CC1B if you're into that sort of
thing. I can also be reached by SIP at <sip:cockli@ekiga.net> or by 
telephone at +1.206 203 6677.

Thanks,
    Vincent Canfield
