Hey John,

I'm sorry for answering so late, this is the first time I've been able to fi=
nd
A quiet place and write to you without the threat of the dreaded exam=20
(that didn't go to badly as a matter of fact) looming over my head.

I'm finally on Holliday, what a relief! I'm glad Maine went well (and hope
Louise and I will make it to the next family reunion, wherever it may be)

Daft Punk concerts must be quite awesome, I do hope they'll tour in 2017
And that I'll be able to check them out!=20
I don't know any of the groups you told me about, but I have complete
Faith in your musical tastes and will most certainly listen to them.

It's true that we do enjoy watching movies (perhaps a bit too much).
As for pen spinning, having never been able to do it properly, I think it sh=
ould
Be considered a hobby, especially if you do it well (which I am sure you do)=
.=20
I entirely approve of your choice of hobbies, and had I not, I might have ha=
d=20
to stop talking to you (I kid you, of course).

Are there any video games that you would recommend for me? As far as=20
PS3 games go we own GTA, Plants vs Zombies and Little big planet and=20
As for computer games we have Minecraft, Sims (I almost didn't write that,
It's kind of embarrassing...) and simcity, and I think I should try to expan=
d=20
My horizons and maybe try to get in touch with my inner gamer.

I'm sorry this e-mail is a little short, but I suffer from post-exam-celebra=
tion-
induced-tiredness, and my eyes are starting to close, I should try to get so=
me
Sleep. I'll write you another e-mail tomorrow with new topics of conversatio=
n,
If you don't beat me to it,

Keep on practicing your guitar!

Love,
Soph.
