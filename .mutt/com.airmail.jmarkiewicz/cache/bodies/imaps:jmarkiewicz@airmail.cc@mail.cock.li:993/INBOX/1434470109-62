Hey John!

I'm sorry I'm taking so much time to answer each time, and I'm also sorry
for
apologising constantly for my lateness. I'm quite the
deadbeat correspondent.

I came back from London late yesterday and have been sleeping and watching
TV ever since. As expected, it was awesome, the city was beautiful and I
got
to make fun of the British accent. The food was really good too (that's an
important
feature for me)
But it's good to be home, even though it's boiling hot (they said it would
get as hot
as 38=C2=B0C this afternoon).

Thanks for having my back!
I wouldn't mind hearing about your past relationship (if you'd like to tell
me
about it of course, I don't want to pry)

Yes I did have the Thai food when we were in Columbus! It was so delicious,
the cost of a plane ticket is almost worth coming to have some.

Haha, the Ar=C3=A8nes de N=C3=AEmes really do rock! Have you seen pictures =
of them?
They're right next to my high school, it's kind of wild, we can see them
from
a few of the chemistry labs' windows. I went to see a Black Keys concert
there
last summer. N=C3=AEmes has some nice Roman architecture.

Yes you must absolutely get caught up on OITNB! I also just finished Sense8=
,
and it was rather good, I recommend it. I did spend the first episode
asking myself
what the hell was going on, but then I got addicted to it. At the moment
I'm (re-)watching
the Walking Dead, it's great if you like zombies. I really liked Hannibal
too, the
cannibalism thing is kind of gross, but I love Mads Mikkelsen, one of
theleading actors.
Have you seen any of these shows? Have you watched Game of Thrones? I
haven't seen
the fifth season yet, so no spoilers if you have!

I started reading the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, but then Louise
took it
with her to Strasbourg so I never got to finish it (that wench). Have you
seen
the movie? It's with Martin Freeman, that guy seems to be playing in
everything
at the moment. Ooh, speaking of him do you know the BBC tv show Sherlock?
It's with him and Benedict Cumberbatch, I love it! There aren't many
episodes,
but it is quality TV. Ok, I might have to stop chattering about tv shows
now.

You are right, I have no love for pop-country.
Speaking of bad music, I recently heard two unbelievably bad songs,
"bitch better have my money" and "bad blood". it's kind of a negative
topic,
but what's the worst song you've heard recently?

I know you like music, but do you like an other forms of art? Like painting=
s
for example? Are there any painters that you like?
 I like Van Gogh, Monet also did quite a few beautiful paintings.
I also like Salvador Dali, he looks like he was a fun guy, his work was
a little weird sometimes, but that doesn't bother me, I'm a little weird
myself.

What is your favourite holiday, if you have one? Mine is Christmas, but the
one I
wish we celebrated here is Thanks giving, because the food is really good!
Sometimes
my mom will get a Turkey and make a pie or something but it's complicated
because
we don't have the day off and have to go to school/work.

What kind of food do you hate? I personally hate cheese (except on pizza
and
a few other things). You're lactose intolerant right? I also don't like
zucchini, especially
in soups. Otherwise, French people enjoy some weird-ass charcuterie that I
don't
really appreciate ("fromage de t=C3=AAte" for example, that translates into
"head cheese",
I don't think it's literally head cheese, but it's really not appetizing)

People don't really go on dates in France, do you have any funny date
stories?
Or do you know any good jokes? I know every time I hear a good joke I tell
myself
"oh yeah, that's a great joke, I should try not forgetting this one!", but
then I always do.
There goes my joke knowledge.

So I'm going to Corsica (a French island in the Mediterranean) from July
27th to
August 11th and I might not have access to my e-mail during that time, I'm
really sorry,
if I ever have a chance I will write to you, for I am also extremely glad
we are corresponding,
and I hope you don't think that I'm not because of my response frequency.
This week though
I will be at home, so I'll respond quicker.

Oh, and I listened to a couple of the songs you told me about, I really
like them,
especially Cut to black by Lemaitre.

Love,
Soph

I hope you have fun in London, it sounds like it&#39;s going to be a blast.=
=C2=A0 I&#39;ve<br>
always kind of wanted to travel without parents or adult-types, so by mysel=
f or<br>
with a friend.=C2=A0 It seems like a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
I would never out anyone for any reason, so your relationship status is saf=
e<br>
with me.=C2=A0 I wouldn&#39;t wish that sort of treatment on my enemies.=C2=
=A0 If I were ever<br>
in a relationship with a guy (and it&#39;s not too unlikely a thing that it=
 would<br>
happen) I certainly wouldn&#39;t want anyone to know anything I didn&#39;t =
tell them.<br>
<br>
Sorry about the fact the relationship might not last, though.=C2=A0 My last=
<br>
relationship was about 3 or 4 months, and it didn&#39;t end on the best ter=
ms.=C2=A0 I<br>
could tell the story, but it&#39;s basically school drama from 7 months or =
so ago<br>
so I don&#39;t know how much you really care to hear of that.=C2=A0 Best of=
 luck,<br>
regardless of what ends up happening.<br>
<br>
Thai food in general is great.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know if you had it while y=
ou were here,<br>
but there&#39;s a fantastic Thai place really close to my house.=C2=A0 Only=
 a couple<br>
minutes&#39; walk.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve heard childbirth, even if it goes without any complications, is no=
t all<br>
that fun.=C2=A0 Neither is pregnancy.=C2=A0 It&#39;s probably a good idea t=
o avoid anything to<br>
do with having kids until later in life, since kids cost a lot of money and=
 time<br>
and they destroy your sleep schedule and they cry a lot.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t really like young kids too much, as a concept.<br>
<br>
Rousseau was pretty cool.=C2=A0 I recently actually read about someone insp=
irational.<br>
Admiral Grace Hopper was a pioneer in computer science and did work with th=
e US<br>
Navy.=C2=A0 She was pretty cool and once said &quot;The most dangerous phra=
se in the<br>
language is, &#39;We&#39;ve always done it this way.&#39;&quot;<br>
<br>
Red Hot Chili Peppers are a great band.=C2=A0 Also, I won&#39;t make fun of=
 you for<br>
liking Earth, Wind, and Fire.=C2=A0 I like a few of their songs.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah also OITNB is a pretty cool show and I need to get caught up on it.=
<br>
<br>
As for answering my own questions, here they are again (for my convenience)=
<br>
&gt; Favorite album, band, song, weather, candy, drink (non-alcoholic, I as=
sume,)<br>
&gt; book, movie, TV show?<br>
Album: current heavy rotation is Justice&#39;s second live album, Access Al=
l Arenas<br>
(recorded at the Arena of N=C3=AEmes, coincidentally) but my favorite all t=
ime album<br>
is much more contested.=C2=A0 Daft Punk&#39;s Alive 2007 is possible, as is=
 Human After<br>
All.=C2=A0 Also maybe Rush&#39;s 2112.=C2=A0 Shit, I don&#39;t know.=C2=A0 =
Band would have to be Daft<br>
Punk (though props to Lemaitre.)=C2=A0 Song is also tricky, I guess current=
 favorite<br>
would be something like Civilization by Justice, and all-time would be Cut =
to<br>
Black by Lemaitre?<br>
<br>
Weather would be overcast and cool enough for a light jacket or maybe overc=
ast<br>
and cold (I have strange taste.)<br>
<br>
Candy would be probably cherry sours or paydays.=C2=A0 Drink would be lemon=
 seltzer,<br>
or plain seltzer.=C2=A0 Pellegrino isn&#39;t bad, especially in a glass bot=
tle.=C2=A0 I like<br>
drinking out of a glass bottle.<br>
<br>
Book is tough because I don&#39;t read enough, but I have a thing for A Clo=
ckwork<br>
Orange and the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide series.=C2=A0 Movie I guess would be =
something by<br>
studio Ghibli, maybe Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.=C2=A0 That movie w=
as great.<br>
TV show would probably be some anime like Jojo&#39;s Bizarre adventure.<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you own any computers?=C2=A0 What kind?=C2=A0 (This question is jus=
t because I&#39;m<br>
&gt; lame and I get interested in these things.)=C2=A0 Actually, on the sub=
ject, are<br>
&gt; there any subjects (like for example, computers,) that most people wou=
ld be<br>
&gt; disinterested in but you really get excited about?<br>
Well, since you (technically) asked, I do!=C2=A0 My main machine, my baby, =
the best<br>
computer I have ever owned and my most favorite possession by a longshot is=
 my<br>
laptop.=C2=A0 It&#39;s a business machine (lenovo W550s if you want the mod=
el number)<br>
with a very long battery life, batteries you can swap out while it&#39;s ru=
nning,<br>
pretty good specs, and an amazing screen.=C2=A0 I could gush about this com=
puter for<br>
a few hundred lines, but I&#39;m going to stop myself a little short.<br>
<br>
I also have a few other computers, and a fancy setup for using my laptop wh=
ile<br>
I&#39;m at home.=C2=A0 The rest of my family has computers too, but they&#3=
9;re less exciting<br>
ones.<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you have any short-term goals?=C2=A0 Short-term as in can be accomp=
lished within<br>
&gt; the next year or so.<br>
Yeah, I guess my goals include setting up a home server and learning a coup=
le<br>
programming languages.=C2=A0 Also I&#39;d like to get accepted into a colle=
ge or<br>
something, though that shouldn&#39;t be a serious problem for me with my ac=
ademic<br>
performance (which, while it has slipped, is still plenty above average and=
<br>
should be enough to get me into OSU.)<br>
<br>
I also want to make more than (basically) minimum wage by the end of the su=
mmer,<br>
and I&#39;m on my way to doing that.<br>
<br>
&gt; Have you ever written any fiction?=C2=A0 Composed any music?<br>
Yeah, but I haven&#39;t completed a fictional story in a while.=C2=A0 I&#39=
;m considering<br>
trying to get into tabletop RPGs which are basically group storytelling wit=
h<br>
game elements.=C2=A0 That would be cool.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve composed a little music, but anything that got recorded has probab=
ly been<br>
lost to the ether and was shitty electronic music stuff anyway.=C2=A0 I&#39=
;ve written a<br>
couple of chord progressions and lines on guitar, but nothing really has ma=
de it<br>
to the &quot;song&quot; stage yet.=C2=A0 Sometime it will, I&#39;m sure.<br=
>
<br>
I&#39;m also pretty easy to get excited about music, and in case the fact I=
 play an<br>
instrument and have a thing for prog rock didn&#39;t give it away I have at=
 least a<br>
passing interest in music theory (though I&#39;m not knowledgable enough fo=
r my own<br>
taste) so if you ever need someone to talk music with I at the least won&#3=
9;t judge<br>
you.=C2=A0 Unless you start talking about pop-country, but I trust you have=
 better<br>
taste than that.<br>
<br>
These e-mails are getting pretty long, but I would say that&#39;s definitel=
y not a<br>
bad thing.=C2=A0 You&#39;re an awful lot of fun to correspond with, so I&#3=
9;m glad we were<br>
able to start doing this.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I&#39;ve traveled, but never really abroad.=C2=A0=
 I like traveling quite a bit, though<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I don&#39;t like sitting in cars and planes.=C2=
=A0 Even having just spent a week out of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 my comfortable bed and house, though, I have to s=
ay I like traveling.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Not currently taken, though I&#39;ve had involved=
 relationships in the past<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 (depending, I suppose, on your definition of &quo=
t;involved.&quot;)=C2=A0 I usually prefer<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 girls to boys (girls are a lot prettier, that&#39=
;s for sure,) but I don&#39;t<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 necessarily rule out the idea I could fall in lov=
e with a man, so it&#39;s good<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 you included the option just in case.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I don&#39;t really have a best friend, since I&#3=
9;ve moved social groups within the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 past year or so.=C2=A0 I have several close frien=
ds, but the term &quot;best friend&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 implies to me a level of friendship I don&#39;t r=
eally currently share with any<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 one person in my life.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 My favorite color is navy blue, my favorite food =
is fried rice.=C2=A0 My favorite<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 album of the moment is the Live album by Justice =
&quot;Access All Arenas&quot; (recorded<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 at the Arena of N=C3=AEmes, as a matter of note.)=
=C2=A0 It&#39;s not my favorite album of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 all time, which I don&#39;t really know.=C2=A0 Fa=
vorite band would have to be Daft Punk<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 with honorable mention to a long list of bands (s=
ome of which you actually<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 have access to thanks to previous e-mails.)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I don&#39;t really know about family projects.=C2=
=A0 I moved my whole household from<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 using Windows to using Linux, which was tricky.=
=C2=A0 Does that count?=C2=A0 I may have<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 kids in the future, though I think the point when=
 I decide to have kids will<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 be quite a while down the line yet.=C2=A0 These d=
ays I&#39;m decidedly not having kids,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 since I can&#39;t support them and wouldn&#39;t e=
njoy having one.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I want to live in a city.=C2=A0 If I could get ou=
t of the US and into a somewhat<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 less terrible (politically and issues-wise) count=
ry, all the better.=C2=A0 I can&#39;t<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 bring myself to move to a place where the interne=
t speed and pricing is bad,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 but most countries are better than we are about t=
hat.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I really enjoy Computer Science (obviously.)=C2=
=A0 I also really love choir class,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I&#39;m in my school&#39;s highest level choir.=
=C2=A0 It&#39;s a lot of fun to sing, especially<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 to sing with a group of people.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I guess there are a few sources of inspiration fo=
r me.=C2=A0 I&#39;m pretty inspired<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 by what Linus Torvalds has done in the world of s=
oftware, it&#39;s pretty amazing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 stuff.=C2=A0 I also am a huge fan of Bernie Sande=
rs, who is showing the United<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 States may not be as politically fucked as we see=
m.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I have to come up with other questions, I guess.=C2=A0 Any=
 of the questions I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; answered up there, but also:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Favorite album, band, song, weather, candy, drink=
 (non-alcoholic, I assume,)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 book, movie, TV show?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Do you own any computers?=C2=A0 What kind?=C2=A0 =
(This question is just because I&#39;m<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 lame and I get interested in these things.)=C2=A0=
 Actually, on the subject, are<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 there any subjects (like for example, computers,)=
 that most people would be<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 disinterested in but you really get excited about=
?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Do you have any short-term goals?=C2=A0 Short-ter=
m as in can be accomplished within<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the next year or so.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Have you ever written any fiction?=C2=A0 Composed=
 any music?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Ah jeez, questions are hard.=C2=A0 Well, between =
your questions and those, there<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 should be plenty for an e-mail.=C2=A0 Add any mor=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey John,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, it would be totally awesome if you came to France=
!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The invitation always stands of course, so if you ever wan=
t to visit,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe give us a call in advance, but we would really enjoy=
 having you here!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok thanks, I&#39;ll check the games out!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, actually, I don&#39;t really know much about our compu=
ter science programs,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can to look into it though if you&#39;d like.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Although I do think there are some schools that might have=
 good programs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like polytech Grenoble or Montpellier, but I don&#39;t kno=
w if that&#39;s really what<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You&#39;re looking for so you&#39;d have to look into it a=
nd see for yourself.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay so I&#39;ve thought about a few conversation topics, =
and here are some<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Questions to which I don&#39;t think I know the answer, yo=
u don&#39;t have to respond<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To all of them if you find them bothersome. Here we go:<br=
>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you ever traveled abroad? Do you like traveling?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a girlfriend? Or a boyfriend, I don&#39;t know=
?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a best friend?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We could also talk about more basic stuff, like what&#39;s=
 your favorite color, or your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Favorite food?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know of your career projects, but do you have any family=
 projects? Do you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Think one day you&#39;ll maybe have kids? (That I could be=
 an aunt to and spoil?)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where would you like to live later, in which country, city=
 or setting?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a favorite subject in school?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there someone who inspires you? A musician, scientist, =
politician, or other?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I realize some of these questions kind of suck, so if you =
have any ideas, do tell!<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Sophie,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t worry too much about the response being a li=
ttle later than<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average.=C2=A0 I can certainly understand having less =
time surrounding tests,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as I think everyone who&#39;s gone through schooling k=
nows things get<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stressful around big tests.=C2=A0 It&#39;s good to hea=
r it went well.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welcome to the break experience.=C2=A0 It&#39;s awesom=
e.=C2=A0 I do hope to see you at<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the next family reunion if I can&#39;t make it over to=
 France before then.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you want to hear what a Daft Punk concert sounded l=
ike a while back,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alive 2007 is a fantastic album.=C2=A0 As far as my mu=
sic tastes go, I tend<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to like some pretty weird stuff, but aside from Swans =
most of what I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; listed there should be fairly listenable.=C2=A0 Swans =
is a good band, but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they&#39;re a little less &quot;accessible&quot; (what=
ever that means.)=C2=A0 Some of the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; music I listen to took a while before I really started=
 enjoying it.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s good you approve of my hobbies.=C2=A0 I would=
 be disappointed in you if<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you had not, and I might have had to stop talking to y=
ou faster than you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have stopped talking to me (I, too, am kidding.)=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as video games, I play mostly old games and PC =
games.=C2=A0 PC games<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worth giving a try: Team Fortress 2 (it&#39;s free, on=
line, and will<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably run ok on any computer you can run minecraft =
well on,) DoTA 2<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (really involved strategy game, also free, a lot of fu=
n once you learn<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mechanics,) Borderlands 2 (costs money and probabl=
y won&#39;t run on<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your PC unless it&#39;s a gaming rig of some sort, but=
 is also available on<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the PS3 and is a lot of fun.)=C2=A0 You can also insta=
ll something known as<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an emulator, which will use your PC to play old consol=
e games.=C2=A0 ZSNES is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an example, you can use it to play old Super Nintendo =
games.=C2=A0 Honorable<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentions go out to the Touhou Project games, which are=
 a little trickier<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to get and very difficult but I love them dearly.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, also Cave Story.=C2=A0 The original is free t=
o download, will run on<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything, and is an amazing game.=C2=A0 Absolutely wor=
th your time if you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to get a little more involved in video games.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll come up with more game recommend=
ations, though I haven&#39;t<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; played nearly as many games in the past 12 months or s=
o as I usually<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any good computer science programs in France=
 (that you know<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of?)=C2=A0 I&#39;m looking into studying in places tha=
t aren&#39;t the US right now<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because our education is pretty damn expensive.=C2=A0 =
My parents are willing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to throw (some) money at the problem whether it&#39;s =
put toward living<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expenses or tuition, and I think it would be cool to s=
tudy in another<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country.=C2=A0 I can do research through other means, =
but I&#39;m curious to see<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your knowledge/thoughts on the subject.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s true that we do enjoy watching movies (pe=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for pen spinning, having never been able to do =

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, being on the road is irritating because =
I can&#39;t get wi-fi in my<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; car and I won&#39;t send e-mails from my phone=
 most of the time, and things<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tend to get away from me when I have a sleep s=
chedule dictated by<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; travel.=C2=A0 I suppose technically I could co=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; store a copy of all mail offline, but that ide=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maine is going well.=C2=A0 Karen seems prone t=
o worrying, but that&#39;s nothing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new.=C2=A0 We went sightseeing at Acadia today=
, and your mother and Baz<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (which I assume is how you spell his name shor=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our group.=C2=A0 It was really laidback and th=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will be over soon, though, which I&#39;m not t=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after driving for two days tires me out, and i=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like spending time outside in the we=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand the malaise, on both fronts, and I =
can&#39;t imagine getting<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone to hang out really close to final exams=
 either, so it would be<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tough on all fronts.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been playing the guitar for a while, =
but only really seriously for<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously.=C2=A0 I ought to practice more, to =
be completely honest.=C2=A0 It&#39;s<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really fun and it gives me an excuse to sing, =
so I like it.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you said percussion in an orchestra=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to be sort of a variety role.=C2=A0 Perc=
ussionists always seem really<br>

 I&#39;ve never really played<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the drums.=C2=A0 Any fancy lines would just be=
 daunting in my eyes.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I love Daft Punk and Phoenix.=C2=A0 They&#39;r=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2007 and 1997.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve listened to reco=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their live work is amazing.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rush and Yes but I also like some newer less w=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kenso.=C2=A0 Swans is a good band, but they&#3=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly not for everyone.=C2=A0 I also have =

 a lot of Justice, Lemaitre, and<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OSU campus is pretty cool, and it&#39;s huge.=
=C2=A0 Really huge.=C2=A0 A lot of people<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; might consider that a bad thing, but honestly =
I consider it good if a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; university is either really huge or really sma=
ll.=C2=A0 We visited the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; College of the Atlantic today, a tiny college,=
 to see a chimney Pete<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; built while he was in Maine.=C2=A0 It seemed p=
leasant, but I have the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suspicion it wouldn&#39;t have much in the way=
 of my major.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reading is fun, though I don&#39;t do enough o=
f it.=C2=A0 I&#39;m not sure if you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could consider watching movies and shows a hob=
by in everyone, but having<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seen how you do it I think you count as a hobb=
yist in the matter.=C2=A0 As<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far as my hobbies are concerned, I play guitar=
 (as mentioned,) I spin<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pens though that may not really count as a hob=
by, I toy with computers<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and operating systems, I program, and I brew a=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; starting to take up bicycling about half as a =
hobby/exercise and half a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means to get to places faster since I don&#39;=
t own a car.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s late and I should probably sl=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On September third, what about you?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think my lack of sociability is due to p=
ure laziness, and to be social I would have to leave<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My house, and it is way to hot outside, or=
 invite people over, and have to clean first<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so I prefer staying in my usual couch pota=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus most of my friends are studying for t=
heir exam, so finding someone to hang out with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is kind of complicated.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The choir and guitar? That&#39;s great! Ho=
w long have you been playing the guitar?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I play some drums, and other instruments, =
including the xylophone (and other xylophone<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Resembling instruments like the vibraphone=
 which is made of metal and the marimba<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is bigger than the xylophone, and no=
t made of the same wood). I also play smaller<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Instruments when I&#39;m with the orchestr=
a or when we do concerts and we play in groups of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percussionists such as the tambourine, mar=
acas, the triangle, Cymbals, djembe, but also<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bigger ones like the kettledrums (I had to=
 look up how to say that in English, because<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in French they&#39;re called timbales), th=
e gong, and even others. Basically I play just about<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every instrument that requires to be hit w=
ith sticks or hands.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t think of any bands that you wo=
uldn&#39;t know in my current playlist, but if I come up with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something, I&#39;ll be sure to tell you! W=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You liked Daft Punk and Phoenix, do you st=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ask you, but at the moment it&#39;s just k=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s cool! I remember visiting the u=
niversity&#39;s campus when we were in Columbus and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thinking it was awesome.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What hobbies do I have? Let&#39;s see... I=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Sophie,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To preface: I&#39;ve been traveling, s=
o this is a little later than I would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have liked.=C2=A0 Sincerest apologies.=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I only got an idea of what I want to d=
o as a career within about the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last 6 months.=C2=A0 Up to that point,=
 I was completely clueless about it,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because before I figured out how much =
I like working with computers it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seemed like anything I was passionate =
about made next to no money.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Studying abroad seems like a lot of fu=
n and a good way to learn a whole<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot more about a place than you can pr=
etty much any other way.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All of your potential fields of study =
are fields I respect, certainly.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Being a teacher in a third world count=
ry is very noble and I&#39;m sure<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be rewarding in its own way, but=
 I don&#39;t think I could be a teacher.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, don&#39;t worry too much about n=
ot knowing what you want to do.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You&#39;ll figure it out at some point=
 here, I imagine.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry about your luck, still having te=
sting to deal with.=C2=A0 Does your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; holiday at least run later than ours, =
or something?=C2=A0 Best of luck<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dealing with the test, I&#39;m sure yo=
u&#39;ll do well.=C2=A0 I understand the way<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; studying gets away from you, it tends =
to do the same for me.=C2=A0 Even if I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have no excuse to go out.=C2=A0 We cer=
tainly would have enjoyed seeing you.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At the conference I would be speaking =
about text analytics with the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; python progrmming language.=C2=A0 It&#=
39;s not the most exciting, but the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exposure would be good and it would be=
 fantastic on a resume.=C2=A0 That and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do like the language.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That sentence alone required me to loo=
k up a couple of words, so a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; letter might take a bit to compose.=C2=
=A0 I&#39;ll give it a try sometime.=C2=A0 Maybe<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after another few letters, you&#39;ll =
get a letter in your own language out<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the blue or something.=C2=A0 Maybe =
not.=C2=A0 Depends how poorly my attempt<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goes, I would guess.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most days you don&#39;t feel like bein=
g social?=C2=A0 Just a lack of motivation,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or is something the matter?=C2=A0 Not =
to pry if something is, of course, and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not assuming something is.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Music is always fun.=C2=A0 I&#39;m inv=
olved in my school&#39;s choir and I play<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guitar as a hobby, so I share the love=
 of music.=C2=A0 What sort of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percussion do you play?=C2=A0 On the s=
ubject of music, do you have any bands<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worth listening to that you would care=
 to recommend to me?=C2=A0 Language and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; country of origin aren&#39;t particula=
rly important, but if you recommend<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; french bands I&#39;m less likely to kn=
ow them.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you ever want an ear to talk about =
drama to, I&#39;m certainly fine with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that.=C2=A0 I understand, though, it m=
ay be a bit troublesome to try and give<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me enough background to understand it.=
=C2=A0 I pretty recently was involved<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in some drama, but at this point I&#39=
;m through dealing with the people who<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; caused it in my life.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After I graduate high school (and that=
 day can not come soon enough) I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plan to study at the Ohio State Univer=
sity.=C2=A0 It&#39;s one of the few places<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can get by without taking on any deb=
t, and they have a pretty great<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Computer Science program.=C2=A0 I thin=
k it will be pretty nice, and few<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; places (at least, in the states) are a=
s inexpensive to live as Columbus<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is without being much less nice.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What sort of hobbies do you have?=C2=
=A0 I know you play percussion, and your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mother mentioned you see a lot of live=
 music, but is there anything else?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I, too, am very glad we&#39;re staying=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Send my regards to the portion of your=

ll, too.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve mostly been sleeping.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Break is always nice for that.=
=C2=A0 Good coffee, good food, all that sort of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff.=C2=A0 I might be speaki=
ng at a conference later this Summer, which<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be cool.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Aussi, je parle fran=C3=A7ais,=
 mais juste un peu.=C2=A0 In fact, I speak such<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little french that I probably =
butchered that sentence (google translate<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinks I did a fine job.)=C2=
=A0 I took a course in it this past year, but it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was frightfully slow.=C2=A0 I =
could have skipped the second level (learning<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it myself) and then moved on t=
o the third level, but my parents said I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should probably just drop it.=
=C2=A0 I&#39;ll self-study instead if I care to keep<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning the language.=C2=A0 I=
 suppose after I understand the language a bit<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better I could try writing let=
ters in it.=C2=A0 That may end up just being a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bit funny.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I think I&#39;m getting ca=
rried away here with the e-mail.=C2=A0 How are you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing lately?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best Wishes,<br>
