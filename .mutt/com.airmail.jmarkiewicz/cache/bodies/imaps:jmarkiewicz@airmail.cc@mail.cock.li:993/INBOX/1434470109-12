Hey John,

No worries, I understand you've been on the road. By the way, how's Maine? H=
ow is
Everyone doing? Are you all having fun?=20

I don't know if our holiday runs later than yours, I think we have to go bac=
k to school
On September third, what about you?

I think my lack of sociability is due to pure laziness, and to be social I w=
ould have to leave
My house, and it is way to hot outside, or invite people over, and have to c=
lean first=20
so I prefer staying in my usual couch potato state.
Plus most of my friends are studying for their exam, so finding someone to h=
ang out with
Is kind of complicated.

The choir and guitar? That's great! How long have you been playing the guita=
r?

I play some drums, and other instruments, including the xylophone (and other=
 xylophone
Resembling instruments like the vibraphone which is made of metal and the ma=
rimba
Which is bigger than the xylophone, and not made of the same wood). I also p=
lay smaller=20
Instruments when I'm with the orchestra or when we do concerts and we play i=
n groups of
percussionists such as the tambourine, maracas, the triangle, Cymbals, djemb=
e, but also=20
bigger ones like the kettledrums (I had to look up how to say that in Englis=
h, because=20
in French they're called timbales), the gong, and even others. Basically I p=
lay just about
Every instrument that requires to be hit with sticks or hands.

I can't think of any bands that you wouldn't know in my current playlist, bu=
t if I come up with
Something, I'll be sure to tell you! What kind of music do you like? I remem=
ber hearing
You liked Daft Punk and Phoenix, do you still like them?

Well if ever the drama gets out of hand and I need some advice from the exte=
rior then I'll
Ask you, but at the moment it's just kind of silly.

That's cool! I remember visiting the university's campus when we were in Col=
umbus and
Thinking it was awesome.

What hobbies do I have? Let's see... I really enjoy reading, watching movies=
 and TV shows
(Does that count?), I sometimes bake, and that's about it. What about you?=20=


Best wishes,
Soph=20
