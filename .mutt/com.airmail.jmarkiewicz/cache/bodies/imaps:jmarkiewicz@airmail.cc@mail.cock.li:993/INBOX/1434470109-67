Hey John,

I think my favourite dish in London was this Indian takeout we tried,
I don't remember its name but it was some kind of chicken in spicy
sauce.
I also got to eat bacon (we don't have any here), so that was great.

Thankfully N=C3=AEmes isn't a very rainy place so at least we don't have to
endure hot and humid weather (I think that's my least favourite)

The Black Keys concert was great, even if I prefer their older albums,
I still appreciate their new stuff, and they put on a great show.

No, we don't really go on dates, sometimes a couple will go see a movie
but we (at least not teenagers) don't go to coffee shops or lunch, and if
we do, we don't consider it a date. Matter of fact, the whole concept of
the date doesn't really exist.
People kiss or hold hands at school or at parties.
I'm not really into public displays of affection so the whole
making out with your boyfriend/girlfriend in front of everybody makes me
a little uncomfortable.

Your underwear story is really funny!

Let's see, drinks that I hate... I don't like green tea, to me it just
tastes
like warm water with a gross minty taste. I hate drinking strong alcohols
without juice or soda or whatever makes them a cocktail, like rhum, vodka,
whiskey, martini... I don't understand why one  would drink such a drink on
its own.
And sometimes, even inside a cocktail it's disgusting, the taste of alcohol
is
overrated.
There are also some really nasty wines, including a grapefruit one, I
thought
it was going to make me sick.

I've never watched any anime, but I don't know why I wouldn't like it,
so I guess I should get to it sooner or latter!

Yes I associate songs to certain times of my life. Sometimes I get sad
for no particular reason, I don't think I'm depressed or anything, but it
can
last from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. Anyway, during those
periods of time, I usually pick a song and spend most of my free
time listening to it. So then a couple of months after I listen to the song
and it makes me think of that time. It can ruin a song for me, but it can
also make me appreciate not feeling crappy anymore.

But I also have a tendency to excessively listen to songs I discover
if ever I like them a lot, and if the time I listen to them is also a time
when
something memorable happens, thinking of the time makes me think of
the song and vice-versa.

I kind of look up to this Japanese marimba player, Keiko Abe. Her music can
be
a little strange sometimes but she revolutionized the way we play marimba,
her technique is rather amazing. Apparently she can play with six sticks
(three in each hand).

I have some cool stories, most of them involve either Baz, Louise or bodily
functions (I'm starting to realize that not all families are as amused as
mine by
the smells, amongst other things, that can emanate from various regions
of the human body).

So anyway, I have two kindergarten stories about Baz that you might find
entertaining. I wasn't present when they occurred, but they have been
told and retold over the years, so I know them by heart.

A little background for the first one: when he was three, Basile was
convinced that he was a dragon. The king of the red dragons to be precise
(for he claimed that the other dragons, the blue and green ones, were
utter garbage and paled in comparison to his superiority). I think that
simple fact is funny enough, but there is more to this story.

One day, my mom went to pick Baz up at the end of the day, and,
like everyday, she asked the teacher if the day had gone well. The teacher
said it had, except for one detail: during the afternoon, while the other
children were playing, Basile, acting like a dragon, had come up behind
her and bitten her right on the butt. He hadn't hurt her or anything, but h=
e
had confirmed our suspicion that he was a strange child.

Today, he says the story is a lie, but we know the truth.

Now for the other story:

My father works late everyday, so he wasn't usually the one to pick us up
from school, but once he had a day off, so he took care of going to get
my brother. He went inside the school, found his classroom, and went
to speak to the teacher. He told her he was here to pick up his son, Basile=
.
This teacher had never seen my father before, and went to ask Baz if he
knew this man that was here to pick him up. My brother who was playing with
a friend looked up, looked at my dad, looked back at his teacher and told
her that no, he did not know that man.

My dad had to go around the school and find one of my old teachers
who recognized him so they were finally able to leave and come home.

Family members are source of many amusing anecdotes, I must have
funny stories with my friends, but none seem to come to my mind at this
instant. Have you got any other cool stories?


Love,
Sophie.

 He went inside the school, found his classroom, and went</div><div>to spea=

<div>This teacher had never seen my father before, and went to ask <span>Ba=

N=C3=AEmes is so hot, It&#39;s pretty damn hot in columbus most days too.=
=C2=A0 We&#39;ve<br>
been getting a lot more rain than is usual during the summer, but it&#39;s<=
br>
still more humid than any human should have to deal with.<br>
<br>
38=C2=B0C is crazy hot, though.=C2=A0 Hope it&#39;s not that warm *and* hum=
id.<br>
<br>
Of course I have your back, that&#39;s what cousins are for.=C2=A0 Now, the=
 story of<br>
my previous relationship:<br>
<br>
For some background, the girl I was dating at the time seemed to me to be<b=
r>
extremely straightforward and honest.=C2=A0 When I first started dating her=
, she<br>
was a part of my main group of friends.=C2=A0 This was my first mistake.<br=
>
<br>
The relationship was fun, and I certainly don&#39;t regret getting involved=
<br>
with her.=C2=A0 We shared an awful lot of interests, and she was very laidb=
ack.<br>
Honestly, the whole thing was super cool and if it hadn&#39;t ended on such=
 a<br>
bad note I would still be her friend.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so the mistake I had made was over-investing emotionally in one<br>
group of friends (a mistake I will absolutely not make again) and it turned=
<br>
out a couple of the people in the group were not the hugest fans of me and<=
br>
were just &quot;being polite.&quot;=C2=A0 I was coming to this conclusion t=
oward the<br>
latter<br>
half of last Summer.<br>
<br>
So the school year started back up, and I was getting weird vibes from my<b=
r>
girlfriend.=C2=A0 I couldn&#39;t figure out exactly what was up.<br>
<br>
One night, she texts me and seems very upset, saying how she doesn&#39;t wa=
nt<br>
to lose a guy like me and how I&#39;ve been a great boyfriend and how she&#=
39;s<br>
been going through a lot of feelings on the subject.=C2=A0 I try to be help=
ful<br>
through it, but still don&#39;t really get what&#39;s happening.<br>
<br>
Two days later, she dumps me over the phone.=C2=A0 No explanation.<br>
<br>
Now, I&#39;m obviously not telling you the entire story, as I don&#39;t thi=
nk you<br>
want a novel&#39;s worth of exposition on the reasons I think it happened.=
=C2=A0 At<br>
the time I was kind of clueless, but I have since reasoned out exactly what=
<br>
led to the events that occurred.=C2=A0 At the time, I was very angry, but i=
n<br>
retrospect I don&#39;t begrudge her at all.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this had a negative effect on my interactions with what, up to that=
<br>
point, had been a very major group of friends in my life.=C2=A0 To say that=
 I<br>
had a bad couple of months would be an understatement, but it taught me a<b=
r>
lot about what not to do when it comes to picking friends.=C2=A0 I have sin=
ce<br>
found better friends, and I&#39;m in a pretty good place now emotionally.<b=
r>
<br>
Well, that was a rambling description of an uninteresting event.=C2=A0 Back=
 to<br>
the scheduled e-mail topics.<br>
<br>
The Ar=C3=A8nes de N=C3=AEmes are really cool.=C2=A0 Roman architecture in =
Columbus is<br>
limited to a couple arches and columns downtown, so it&#39;s really cool th=
at<br>
N=C3=AEmes has a full-blown Roman amphitheatre.=C2=A0 How was the Black Key=
s concert?<br>
I like their work, though I feel they were better on older albums before<br=
>
they got more instrumentation and got overproduced.=C2=A0 That&#39;s just m=
y<br>
opinion, though.<br>
<br>
The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones are on the list of shows I&#39;ve been=
<br>
told I need to watch and I haven&#39;t yet.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve heard so many go=
od things<br>
about both series (serieses?=C2=A0 English is hard) but for some reason I<b=
r>
haven&#39;t started on either.<br>
<br>
What a punk Louise is, taking a good book to Strasbourg with her.=C2=A0 I t=
hink<br>
I&#39;ve seen the movie, but it would have been quite some time ago that I<=
br>
watched it.=C2=A0 I ought to rewatch it, since I enjoyed the movie quite a =
bit<br>
the first time I watched it.=C2=A0 I haven&#39;t seen Sherlock, but it&#39;=
s another<br>
series I&#39;ve been told I must watch.<br>
<br>
As far as really bad songs, I suppose the worst one I&#39;ve heard recently=
<br>
would have to be something by IceJJFish, but he&#39;s obviously not serious=
<br>
with his music:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 <a href=3D"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9I=

s://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9IzZ4Qm5_48&amp;feature=3Dyoutu.be</a><br>
<br>
Most of the music I&#39;m really distasteful for isn&#39;t especially terri=
ble,<br>
it&#39;s just bland.=C2=A0 Most of the stuff that gets incredibly popular a=
round<br>
here falls into that category.=C2=A0 If I have to hear &quot;California Gir=
ls&quot; one<br>
more time I swear someone is going to die.<br>
<br>
I like Thanksgiving, but I like Halloween more I would say.=C2=A0 It&#39;s =
an excuse<br>
for people to dress up and eat candy, which is really all you need to get<b=
r>
me on board with a holiday.=C2=A0 Christmas is fun too, but the strongly<br=
>
religious get noisy around that time of year here.=C2=A0 Actually, they&#39=
;re<br>
always noisy.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t have a problem with religion, until people =
try to<br>
pass it into law or force it on me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back on topic.<br>
<br>
I can&#39;t stand cheese, regardless of what it&#39;s on, since I can&#39;t=
 have milk.<br>
It&#39;s technically not lactose intolerance, but the actual distinction is=
<br>
kind of pointless to make and boring.=C2=A0 As a result, I don&#39;t really=
 enjoy<br>
buttery, creamy type food.=C2=A0 It seems like there&#39;s this idea that p=
utting<br>
butter or cheese on something will make it tastier, when in reality all it<=
br>
does is ruin it.<br>
<br>
People don&#39;t go on dates in France?=C2=A0 When else are you supposed to=
 hold<br>
hands with your significant other, or kiss them?=C2=A0 I don&#39;t really h=
ave a<br>
funny date story, but I do have a funny story involving someone I was<br>
dating at the time.<br>
<br>
I was coming home from hanging out with some friends of mine, and my mother=
<br>
is furious.=C2=A0 She doesn&#39;t say why, but I can tell she&#39;s beyond =
livid.=C2=A0 I<br>
finally get from her why she&#39;s mad, and she accuses me of having sex wi=
th<br>
my girlfriend in my parents&#39; bed.=C2=A0 I hadn&#39;t had sex with this =
girl at all,<br>
let alone in my parents&#39; bed, so you can understand why I would be shoc=
ked<br>
and confused.<br>
<br>
I respond by asking &quot;Why the hell would I do that, and why would you t=
hink<br>
I would do that?&quot;<br>
<br>
She said back to me &quot;Well, I found women&#39;s underwear in my bed, an=
d they&#39;re<br>
definitely not my underwear.&quot;<br>
<br>
We argue back and forth for a while, because earlier in the weekend I had<b=
r>
done laundry and there was a pair of underwear at the bottom of my basket<b=
r>
that I had casually assumed were my mothers and I set them on her bed.=C2=
=A0 She<br>
ends up yelling at me to go look at the underwear, and about how obviously<=
br>
they couldn&#39;t have been her underwear.<br>
<br>
Now, I don&#39;t know how most people would react to a strange pair of pant=
ies<br>
just sitting at the bottom of their laundry basket, but I just thought &quo=
t;I<br>
don&#39;t know whose these are, and the only woman living in this house is =
my<br>
mother.&quot;=C2=A0 In retrospect, they were definitely not her sort of und=
erwear,<br>
though in fairness my girlfriend of the time wouldn&#39;t be caught wearing=
 a<br>
leopard-print thong either.<br>
<br>
I go up, and on the band of the underwear is an orange cat hair.=C2=A0 At t=
his<br>
point, everything makes sense.<br>
<br>
At the time, we had been letting my cousin do laundry at our place while<br=
>
she was getting on her feet.=C2=A0 She had just moved in from Maine, and sh=
e<br>
owned an orange cat.<br>
<br>
I wish I had had a camera to take a picture of the face my mom made when<br=
>
she realized I was telling the truth and she had just yelled at me for<br>
three hours at 9 in the morning for no reason.=C2=A0 That single moment may=
 have<br>
been the biggest &quot;I told you so&quot; in my whole life.<br>
<br>
Most of my actual dates have been really plain, like going to coffee shops<=
br>
or getting lunch or going to the movies.=C2=A0 They were fun, but not super=
<br>
entertaining stories.=C2=A0 I have one decent story but I should save that =
for<br>
an e-mail where it&#39;s not already insanely long with stories already.<br=
>
<br>
As far as jokes go, I rely far more on timing and delivery than actually<br=
>
remembering jokes.=C2=A0 I suffer from the same issue you do, and when I th=
ink a<br>
joke is funny enough to remember for a little while it&#39;s usually only<b=
r>
really funny to me.<br>
<br>
Lemaitre are a pretty important band to me, but more because of when I&#39;=
ve<br>
listened to them than the band themselves.=C2=A0 That song in particular, b=
ut<br>
their work in general, has helped me through some rough patches.=C2=A0 I&#3=
9;m glad<br>
you enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
Well, since we&#39;re asking least favorites, what drink(s) do you hate?=C2=
=A0 For<br>
me, I don&#39;t like putting anything in coffee, or trying to do anything f=
ancy<br>
with it.=C2=A0 The only thing I think should be added to espresso is water,=
 but<br>
I would rather just drink any coffee straight.=C2=A0 I also really don&#39;=
t enjoy<br>
carrot juice.<br>
<br>
Do you like any anime?=C2=A0 I have a thing for Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventur=
e.=C2=A0 It&#39;s<br>
over-the-top and silly and has a lot of really muscular men, but my<br>
favorite part about it is that the whole show doesn&#39;t take itself serio=
usly<br>
at all.<br>
<br>
Are there any artists/albums/songs you associate with a particular time in<=
br>
your life or a specific feeling?=C2=A0 Lemaitre was an example I mentioned =
a<br>
couple paragraphs back, but if you point to any song I&#39;ve listened to<b=
r>
obsessively I probably associate it with a specific time in my life.<br>
<br>
Since you play percussion, are there any drummers/percussionists you enjoy<=
br>
especially or look up to?=C2=A0 I know as a guitarist I look up to Eric Cla=
pton,<br>
Steven Wilson, Steve Howe, and so many other musicians.=C2=A0 As a vocalist=
, I look<br>
up to a lot of people (there are a lot of really nice voices out there) but=
<br>
lately I&#39;ve been really into Dan Avidan&#39;s voice.<br>
<br>
Any cool stories?=C2=A0 (This one is open-ended, since I don&#39;t know if =
my other<br>
questions will generate as much dialogue as you may want.)<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes I did have the Thai food when we were in Columbus! It was so delic=
ious,<br>
&gt; the cost of a plane ticket is almost worth coming to have some.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Haha, the Ar=C3=A8nes de N=C3=AEmes really do rock! Have you seen pict=
ures of them?<br>
&gt; They&#39;re right next to my high school, it&#39;s kind of wild, we ca=

&gt; from<br>
&gt; a few of the chemistry labs&#39; windows. I went to see a Black Keys c=

&gt; there<br>
&gt; last summer. N=C3=AEmes has some nice Roman architecture.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes you must absolutely get caught up on OITNB! I also just finished S=
ense8,<br>
&gt; and it was rather good, I recommend it. I did spend the first episode<=
br>
&gt; asking myself<br>
&gt; what the hell was going on, but then I got addicted to it. At the mome=
nt<br>
&gt; I&#39;m (re-)watching<br>
&gt; the Walking Dead, it&#39;s great if you like zombies. I really liked H=
annibal<br>
&gt; too, the<br>
&gt; cannibalism thing is kind of gross, but I love Mads Mikkelsen, one of<=

&gt; theleading actors.<br>
&gt; Have you seen any of these shows? Have you watched Game of Thrones? I<=
br>
&gt; haven&#39;t seen<br>
&gt; the fifth season yet, so no spoilers if you have!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I started reading the Hitchhiker&#39;s guide to the galaxy, but then L=
ouise<br>
&gt; took it<br>
&gt; with her to Strasbourg so I never got to finish it (that wench). Have =
you<br>
&gt; seen<br>
&gt; the movie? It&#39;s with Martin Freeman, that guy seems to be playing =
in<br>
&gt; everything<br>
&gt; at the moment. Ooh, speaking of him do you know the BBC tv show Sherlo=
ck?<br>
&gt; It&#39;s with him and Benedict Cumberbatch, I love it! There aren&#39;=
t many<br>
&gt; episodes,<br>
&gt; but it is quality TV. Ok, I might have to stop chattering about tv sho=

&gt; now.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You are right, I have no love for pop-country.<br>
&gt; Speaking of bad music, I recently heard two unbelievably bad songs,<br=

&gt; &quot;bitch better have my money&quot; and &quot;bad blood&quot;. it&#=

&gt; topic,<br>
&gt; but what&#39;s the worst song you&#39;ve heard recently?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I know you like music, but do you like an other forms of art? Like pai=
ntings<br>
&gt; for example? Are there any painters that you like?<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 I like Van Gogh, Monet also did quite a few beautiful paintings.=
<br>
&gt; I also like Salvador Dali, he looks like he was a fun guy, his work wa=

&gt;<br>
&gt; What is your favourite holiday, if you have one? Mine is Christmas, bu=

&gt; one I<br>

&gt; Sometimes<br>
&gt; my mom will get a Turkey and make a pie or something but it&#39;s comp=

&gt; because<br>
&gt; we don&#39;t have the day off and have to go to school/work.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What kind of food do you hate? I personally hate cheese (except on piz=
za<br>
&gt; and<br>
&gt; a few other things). You&#39;re lactose intolerant right? I also don&#=
39;t like<br>
&gt; zucchini, especially<br>
&gt; in soups. Otherwise, French people enjoy some weird-ass charcuterie th=

&gt; don&#39;t<br>
&gt; really appreciate (&quot;fromage de t=C3=AAte&quot; for example, that =

&gt;<br>
&gt; People don&#39;t really go on dates in France, do you have any funny d=

&gt; Or do you know any good jokes? I know every time I hear a good joke I =
tell<br>

&gt; &quot;oh yeah, that&#39;s a great joke, I should try not forgetting th=

&gt;<br>
&gt; So I&#39;m going to Corsica (a French island in the Mediterranean) fro=

&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Hey Sophie,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I hope you have fun in London, it sounds like it&#39;s going to be a bl=
ast.<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve<br>
&gt;&gt; always kind of wanted to travel without parents or adult-types, so=
 by<br>
&gt;&gt; myself or<br>
&gt;&gt; with a friend.=C2=A0 It seems like a lot of fun.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I would never out anyone for any reason, so your relationship stat=
us is<br>
&gt;&gt; safe<br>
&gt;&gt; with me.=C2=A0 I wouldn&#39;t wish that sort of treatment on my en=
emies.=C2=A0 If I were<br>
&gt;&gt; ever<br>
&gt;&gt; in a relationship with a guy (and it&#39;s not too unlikely a thin=
g that it<br>
&gt;&gt; would<br>
&gt;&gt; happen) I certainly wouldn&#39;t want anyone to know anything I di=
dn&#39;t tell<br>
&gt;&gt; them.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Sorry about the fact the relationship might not last, though.=C2=
=A0 My last<br>
&gt;&gt; relationship was about 3 or 4 months, and it didn&#39;t end on the=
 best<br>
&gt;&gt; terms.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt;&gt; could tell the story, but it&#39;s basically school drama from 7 m=
onths or so<br>
&gt;&gt; ago<br>
&gt;&gt; so I don&#39;t know how much you really care to hear of that.=C2=
=A0 Best of luck,<br>
&gt;&gt; regardless of what ends up happening.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Thai food in general is great.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know if you had i=
t while you were<br>
&gt;&gt; here,<br>
&gt;&gt; but there&#39;s a fantastic Thai place really close to my house.=
=C2=A0 Only a couple<br>
&gt;&gt; minutes&#39; walk.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve heard childbirth, even if it goes without any complicatio=
ns, is not<br>
&gt;&gt; all<br>
&gt;&gt; that fun.=C2=A0 Neither is pregnancy.=C2=A0 It&#39;s probably a go=
od idea to avoid<br>
&gt;&gt; anything to<br>
&gt;&gt; do with having kids until later in life, since kids cost a lot of =
money<br>
&gt;&gt; and time<br>
&gt;&gt; and they destroy your sleep schedule and they cry a lot.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really like young kids too much, as a concept.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Rousseau was pretty cool.=C2=A0 I recently actually read about som=
eone<br>
&gt;&gt; inspirational.<br>
&gt;&gt; Admiral Grace Hopper was a pioneer in computer science and did wor=
k with<br>
&gt;&gt; the US<br>
&gt;&gt; Navy.=C2=A0 She was pretty cool and once said &quot;The most dange=
rous phrase in the<br>
&gt;&gt; language is, &#39;We&#39;ve always done it this way.&#39;&quot;<br=
>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Red Hot Chili Peppers are a great band.=C2=A0 Also, I won&#39;t ma=
ke fun of you for<br>
&gt;&gt; liking Earth, Wind, and Fire.=C2=A0 I like a few of their songs.<b=
r>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah also OITNB is a pretty cool show and I need to get caught =
up on it.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; As for answering my own questions, here they are again (for my con=
venience)<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Favorite album, band, song, weather, candy, drink (non-alcoho=
lic, I<br>
&gt;&gt; assume,)<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; book, movie, TV show?<br>
&gt;&gt; Album: current heavy rotation is Justice&#39;s second live album, =
Access All<br>
&gt;&gt; Arenas<br>
&gt;&gt; (recorded at the Arena of N=C3=AEmes, coincidentally) but my favor=
ite all time<br>
&gt;&gt; album<br>
&gt;&gt; is much more contested.=C2=A0 Daft Punk&#39;s Alive 2007 is possib=
le, as is Human<br>
&gt;&gt; After<br>
&gt;&gt; All.=C2=A0 Also maybe Rush&#39;s 2112.=C2=A0 Shit, I don&#39;t kno=
w.=C2=A0 Band would have to be<br>
&gt;&gt; Daft<br>
&gt;&gt; Punk (though props to Lemaitre.)=C2=A0 Song is also tricky, I gues=
s current<br>
&gt;&gt; favorite<br>
&gt;&gt; would be something like Civilization by Justice, and all-time woul=
d be Cut<br>
&gt;&gt; to<br>
&gt;&gt; Black by Lemaitre?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Weather would be overcast and cool enough for a light jacket or ma=
ybe<br>
&gt;&gt; overcast<br>
&gt;&gt; and cold (I have strange taste.)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Candy would be probably cherry sours or paydays.=C2=A0 Drink would=
 be lemon<br>
&gt;&gt; seltzer,<br>
&gt;&gt; or plain seltzer.=C2=A0 Pellegrino isn&#39;t bad, especially in a =
glass bottle.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt;&gt; like<br>
&gt;&gt; drinking out of a glass bottle.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Book is tough because I don&#39;t read enough, but I have a thing =
for A<br>
&gt;&gt; Clockwork<br>
&gt;&gt; Orange and the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide series.=C2=A0 Movie I guess =

&gt;&gt; &gt; there any subjects (like for example, computers,) that most p=

&gt;&gt; be<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; disinterested in but you really get excited about?<br>
&gt;&gt; Well, since you (technically) asked, I do!=C2=A0 My main machine, =
my baby, the<br>
&gt;&gt; best<br>
&gt;&gt; computer I have ever owned and my most favorite possession by a lo=
ngshot<br>
&gt;&gt; is my<br>
&gt;&gt; laptop.=C2=A0 It&#39;s a business machine (lenovo W550s if you wan=

&gt;&gt; with a very long battery life, batteries you can swap out while it=
&#39;s<br>
&gt;&gt; running,<br>
&gt;&gt; pretty good specs, and an amazing screen.=C2=A0 I could gush about=
 this<br>
&gt;&gt; computer for<br>
&gt;&gt; a few hundred lines, but I&#39;m going to stop myself a little sho=
rt.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I also have a few other computers, and a fancy setup for using my =
laptop<br>
&gt;&gt; while<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m at home.=C2=A0 The rest of my family has computers too, bu=
t they&#39;re less<br>
&gt;&gt; exciting<br>
&gt;&gt; ones.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you have any short-term goals?=C2=A0 Short-term as in can =
be accomplished<br>
&gt;&gt; within<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the next year or so.<br>
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess my goals include setting up a home server and learni=
ng a<br>
&gt;&gt; couple<br>
&gt;&gt; programming languages.=C2=A0 Also I&#39;d like to get accepted int=
o a college or<br>
&gt;&gt; something, though that shouldn&#39;t be a serious problem for me w=
ith my<br>
&gt;&gt; academic<br>
&gt;&gt; performance (which, while it has slipped, is still plenty above av=
erage and<br>
&gt;&gt; should be enough to get me into OSU.)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I also want to make more than (basically) minimum wage by the end =
of the<br>
&gt;&gt; summer,<br>
&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m on my way to doing that.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Have you ever written any fiction?=C2=A0 Composed any music?<=
br>
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I haven&#39;t completed a fictional story in a while.=C2=

&gt;&gt; considering<br>

&gt;&gt; with<br>
&gt;&gt; game elements.=C2=A0 That would be cool.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve composed a little music, but anything that got recorded h=

&gt;&gt; lost to the ether and was shitty electronic music stuff anyway.=C2=
=A0 I&#39;ve<br>
&gt;&gt; written a<br>
&gt;&gt; couple of chord progressions and lines on guitar, but nothing real=

&gt;&gt; to the &quot;song&quot; stage yet.=C2=A0 Sometime it will, I&#39;m=
 sure.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m also pretty easy to get excited about music, and in case t=
he fact I<br>
&gt;&gt; play an<br>
&gt;&gt; instrument and have a thing for prog rock didn&#39;t give it away =
I have at<br>
&gt;&gt; least a<br>
&gt;&gt; passing interest in music theory (though I&#39;m not knowledgable =
enough for<br>
&gt;&gt; my own<br>

&gt;&gt; judge<br>
&gt;&gt; you.=C2=A0 Unless you start talking about pop-country, but I trust=
 you have<br>
&gt;&gt; better<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; These e-mails are getting pretty long, but I would say that&#39;s =

&gt;&gt; not a<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Alone, so I think it&#39;ll be quite fun.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am currently in a relationship with a girl, though you are =
the only<br>
&gt;&gt; family<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Member to know this, so I&#39;m counting on your discretion. =
Today is<br>
&gt;&gt; actually our<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Fourth month anniversary, but to be honest I don&#39;t know i=

&gt;&gt; last<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Much longer, which is sad. I&#39;ve also been with boys, but =
this is the<br>
&gt;&gt; first<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Real relationship I&#39;ve ever had.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think my favorite color at the moment red, And my favorite =
food is Thai<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; noodles, but it is extremely hard to find decent ones in Fran=
ce.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t really have any family projects, I did try to con=
vince my family<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; To move to New Zealand, but they weren&#39;t very enthusiasti=
c,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; So I guess I&#39;ll just have to maybe do it on my own one da=
y.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The thought of having kids (in a few years) was rather appeal=
ing to me<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Until Louise, who, as you must know it, studies biology, told=
 me in a<br>
&gt;&gt; very<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Detailed manner about childbirth and breastfeeding and other =
shit,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; So now I&#39;m contemplating adoption, or just not having kid=

&gt;&gt; &gt; Something I really worry about, since if it must happen, it w=

&gt;&gt; in at<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Least ten years.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Having always lived in a city, even though I enjoy the countr=

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; My favorite subject depends as much on the teacher as on the =
subject<br>
&gt;&gt; itself,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; So this year I think my favorite subjects were math and physi=
cs.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; There are some philosophers who inspire me, like Jean Jacques=
 Rousseau<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Who wrote texts against slavery, but also women&#39;s rights =
activists.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think my favorite album is either The head on the door (by =
the Cure) or<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark side of the moon. I don&#39;t really ha=
ve a favorite band,<br>
&gt;&gt; just<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Many bands that I enjoy, like Phoenix, Daft Punk, Metronomy, =
the Red Hot<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Chili Peppers, Belle and Sebastian (hippie music, my mom woul=
d say),<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and others. My favorite song changes all the time, but at the=
 moment it&#39;s<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Get down on it by Earth Wind and Fire (you are authorized to =
make fun<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Of me).<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; My favorite candy is peanuts m&amp;m&#39;s, my favorite drink=
 is Schweppes.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I love rainstorms, my favorite book is the Spellman Files by =
Lisa Lutz,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have a favorite movie and my favorite TV show is =
30 rock<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Or Orange is the new black.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes I own a computer, it&#39;s a piece of shit dell laptop (s=
orry I can&#39;t<br>
&gt;&gt; tell you<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; More about it) that is given to every sophomore in my region =
as part of a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Program that is supposed to enable people who don&#39;t own a=
 computer<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; To be able to work on one (but everyone just ends up watching=
 movies<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; With theirs). We also have one &quot;house computer&quot; and=
 an Asus laptop.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I can get rather excited about music, and I don&#39;t have ma=
ny musician<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Friends, so they always look at me like I&#39;m the biggest n=
erd when I start<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Talking about this rhythm that I learned or when I try tellin=
g them<br>
&gt;&gt; something<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I found funny during a music class but that they don&#39;t un=
derstand.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I guess my biggest short time goal is getting good grades at =
the bac<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; And finding and getting accepted at a good university. It&#39=
;s not very<br>
&gt;&gt; exciting,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; But that&#39;s it.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never written any fiction, I have thought about it a=
 couple of<br>
&gt;&gt; times,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; But have always lacked inspiration.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never composed any music either, but it would be so =
much fun if<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I ever got to it!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t got any ideas for new questions, but I&#39;d li=

&gt;&gt; answers<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; You would give to the ones you asked me!<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a girlfriend? Or a boyfriend, I don&#=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have a best friend?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We could also talk about more basic stuff, like w=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Favorite food?<br>

&gt;&gt; ZSNES is<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt; you<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could consider watching movies and sh=

&gt;&gt; having<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seen how you do it I think you count =

&gt;&gt; how&#39;s Maine? How is<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know if our holiday r=

&gt;&gt; have to go back to school<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On September third, what about yo=
u?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think my lack of sociability is=
 due to pure laziness, and to be<br>
&gt;&gt; social I would have to leave<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My house, and it is way to hot ou=
tside, or invite people over,<br>
&gt;&gt; and have to clean first<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so I prefer staying in my usual c=
ouch potato state.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus most of my friends are study=
ing for their exam, so finding<br>
&gt;&gt; someone to hang out with<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is kind of complicated.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The choir and guitar? That&#39;s =
great! How long have you been<br>
&gt;&gt; playing the guitar?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I play some drums, and other inst=
ruments, including the xylophone<br>
&gt;&gt; (and other xylophone<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Resembling instruments like the v=
ibraphone which is made of metal<br>
&gt;&gt; and the marimba<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is bigger than the xylophon=
e, and not made of the same<br>
&gt;&gt; wood). I also play smaller<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Instruments when I&#39;m with the=
 orchestra or when we do concerts<br>
&gt;&gt; and we play in groups of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percussionists such as the tambou=
rine, maracas, the triangle,<br>
&gt;&gt; Cymbals, djembe, but also<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bigger ones like the kettledrums =
(I had to look up how to say<br>
&gt;&gt; that in English, because<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in French they&#39;re called timb=
ales), the gong, and even others.<br>
&gt;&gt; Basically I play just about<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every instrument that requires to=
 be hit with sticks or hands.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t think of any bands th=
at you wouldn&#39;t know in my current<br>
&gt;&gt; playlist, but if I come up with<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something, I&#39;ll be sure to te=
ll you! What kind of music do you<br>
&gt;&gt; like? I remember hearing<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You liked Daft Punk and Phoenix, =
do you still like them?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well if ever the drama gets out o=
f hand and I need some advice<br>
&gt;&gt; from the exterior then I&#39;ll<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ask you, but at the moment it&#39=
;s just kind of silly.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s cool! I remember visit=

&gt;&gt; were in Columbus and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thinking it was awesome.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What hobbies do I have? Let&#39;s=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I only got an idea of what I =

&gt;&gt; the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last 6 months.=C2=A0 Up to th=
at point, I was completely clueless<br>
&gt;&gt; about it,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because before I figured out =
how much I like working with<br>
&gt;&gt; computers it<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seemed like anything I was pa=
ssionate about made next to no<br>
&gt;&gt; money.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Studying abroad seems like a =
lot of fun and a good way to learn<br>
&gt;&gt; a whole<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot more about a place than y=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All of your potential fields =

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Being a teacher in a third wo=

&gt;&gt; sure<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be rewarding in its own=
 way, but I don&#39;t think I could be<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, don&#39;t worry too muc=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You&#39;ll figure it out at s=

on studying it and start writing<br>
&gt;&gt; letters in it,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t hesitate to sen=
d me some!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So anyway, lately I&#39;v=
e been trying to study for my oral<br>
&gt;&gt; examination (which is on Friday the third),<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I&#39;ve failed, bein=
g tempted to go out and read and watch<br>
&gt;&gt; movies instead.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I won&#39;t lie to yo=
u, most days I don&#39;t feel like being<br>
&gt;&gt; social so there isn&#39;t much going out.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve also been playin=
g music, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve mentioned it<br>
&gt;&gt; before but I play percussion,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I&#39;ve been practic=
ing with the orchestra for our upcoming<br>
&gt;&gt; concert, but the parts I play<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aren&#39;t that challengi=
ng so it&#39;s not stressful, which is a<br>
&gt;&gt; relief.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that&#39;s about =
all that&#39;s been going on lately with me<br>
&gt;&gt; lately, I won&#39;t bother you with any<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of my high school drama, =
it wouldn&#39;t make any sense to you<br>
&gt;&gt; anyway.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sorry if the thou=
ghts I express in this e-mail are a little<br>
&gt;&gt; scattered,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not a very organi=
zed person...<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So where do you want to s=
tudy after graduation?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m very glad we&#39;=
re staying in contact!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Send my love to your pare=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Sophie,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m good.=C2=A0 I=
 think I&#39;m supposed to write e-mails like they&#39;re<br>
&gt;&gt; letters,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I haven&#39;t wri=
tten letters much.=C2=A0 It&#39;s an old-fashioned<br>
&gt;&gt; art.=C2=A0 Hell,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even e-mail is kind o=
f old-fashioned these days.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lately, I&#39;ve gott=
en very into computers.=C2=A0 I plan to eventually<br>
&gt;&gt; get a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; career in computer sc=
ience.=C2=A0 Something about the subject is<br>
&gt;&gt; really fun,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and there&#39;s a bit=
 of money to be had in the field.=C2=A0 Ideally,<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll have<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my own proper mailser=
ver with a custom domain soon, so I may<br>
&gt;&gt; be moving<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from e-mail to e-mail=
 again within the next few months.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll<br>
&gt;&gt; end up<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maintaining all my pr=
evious addresses, of course, but I always<br>
&gt;&gt; have one<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I prefer to give peop=
le.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Summer has been treat=
ing me well, too.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve mostly been<br>
&gt;&gt; sleeping.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Break is always nice =
for that.=C2=A0 Good coffee, good food, all<br>
&gt;&gt; that sort of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff.=C2=A0 I might =
be speaking at a conference later this Summer,<br>
&gt;&gt; which<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be cool.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Aussi, je parle fran=
=C3=A7ais, mais juste un peu.=C2=A0 In fact, I speak<br>
&gt;&gt; such<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little french that I =
probably butchered that sentence (google<br>
&gt;&gt; translate<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thinks I did a fine j=
ob.)=C2=A0 I took a course in it this past<br>
&gt;&gt; year, but it<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was frightfully slow.=
=C2=A0 I could have skipped the second level<br>
&gt;&gt; (learning<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it myself) and then m=
oved on to the third level, but my<br>
&gt;&gt; parents said I<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should probably just =
drop it.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll self-study instead if I<br>
&gt;&gt; care to keep<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning the language=
.=C2=A0 I suppose after I understand the<br>
&gt;&gt; language a bit<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better I could try wr=
iting letters in it.=C2=A0 That may end up<br>
&gt;&gt; just being a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bit funny.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I think I&#39;m g=
etting carried away here with the e-mail.<br>
&gt;&gt; How are you<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing lately?<br>
