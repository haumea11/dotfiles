(1) Ninja Sex Party: Attitude City
(1) Ninja Sex Party: NSFW
(1) Ninja Sex Party: Strawberries and Cream


Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized
contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.

A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make sure
they were in the best possible condition before mailing. Our
world-renowned packing specialist lit a local artisan candle and a hush
fell over the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box
that money can buy.

We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
Portland waved "Bon Voyage!" to your package, on its way to you, in our
private CD Baby jet on this day, July 17, 2015.

We hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. In commemoration,
we have placed your picture on our wall as "Customer of the Year." We're
all exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Sigh...
We miss you already. We'll be right here at http://cdbaby.com/,
patiently awaiting your return.
