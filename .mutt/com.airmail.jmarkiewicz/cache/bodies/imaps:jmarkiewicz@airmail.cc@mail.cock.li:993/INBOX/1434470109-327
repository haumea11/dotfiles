Hi John,

      This is great to hear. November 21 is the beginning of the celebration=
 of Christ the King Sunday. The Music should reflect that idea in text and a=
ttitude. I will do some hunting around and pull some potentials.

Thanks,

Hey Mr. Medley,

Sorry I hadn't replied to your previous e-mail.  Computer issues had
left me fighting a losing battle to keep up with my inbox.  I'll have
last week's payment along with the payment for this week.

I'd be glad to try to have something together for November 21st.  If I
can get auditions out of the way this week, I think it could be
doable.  What sort of piece were you thinking?

Best Wishes,
John Markiewicz
