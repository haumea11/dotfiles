If your financial situation is that of need then the liberal arts schools ge=
nerally will meet you where you are able.

Yes OSU could work. Let me guide you towards someone to talk to about double=
 degree in voice and something else at OSU.

More on this later. Basically, depending on your parents income, don't neces=
sarily let the price tag of a Universoty scare you.

Thanks,

These schools look interesting (though expensive.)  What are your
thoughts on OSU's music program?  I wouldn't qualify for need-based
scholarships for the most part, so I would either need to be able to
(mostly) afford tuition (my parents are willing to give a flexible
"about 10 grand") or have some sort of merit based scholarship.  Debt
is scary.

This is all very exciting.

Best Wishes,
John Markiewicz
