Hey John,

It's okay, I understand.  I'm glad we're talking again though!
Let's see, I stayed in N=C3=AEmes for most of the summer, seeing friends an=
d,
well, not doing much.  It was fun!  I saw family too (well the french
side).  My cousin moved to Missouri, for college, so we hung out a little
before he left.

I've been in Strasbourg for the past two weeks, staying at a friend's house
while I look for an appartment.  I've found one, and now I'm just waiting
to sign the lease.  It's nice, and it's right in the center of Strasbourg.
I don't know if you've heard about it, but each year there's a big
christmas market here, and my appartment will be right above it.  Anyway,
I'm very happy about this!  I've been harassing everyone for the past month
about appartments, and now I'm harassing you, ahah!

My classes start again next Monday. I'm a sophomore now!  I think it's
going to be harder this year, but I'm prepared.  Mary offered me a job for
next summer, working in her lab for a few months.  So that should be
awesome!  I have a goal for school

What classes do you have this year?  When do you have to start applications
for college?
I hope we see each othet soon, you're aways invited to crash with us!

Love,
Louise

 some of them are<br>
&gt; really good.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know Studio Ghibli, I&#39;ll check it o=
ut.=C2=A0 We have so<br>
&gt; many movies here.=C2=A0 I always love Harry Potter and the Lord of the=
 Rings.<br>
&gt; Classics...<br>
&gt; For TV shows, I really like 30 rock, scrubs, Game of thrones, chuck.=
=C2=A0 How I<br>
&gt; met your mother and Big bang theory are pretty good too. It&#39;s so a=
ddictive<br>
&gt; though!=C2=A0 What about you?<br>
&gt; Now books, I&#39;m reading &#39;He named me Malala&quot;.=C2=A0 I also=
 loved the Hitchhiker&#39;s<br>
&gt; guide, I had like a little obsession with douglas adams and read all h=
is<br>
&gt; books.=C2=A0 a couple years ago.=C2=A0 I love reading.<br>
&gt; Yeah, for schools in France, it&#39;s a little complicated.=C2=A0 You =
need to do a<br>
&gt; two year program after high school (after the BAC), called pr=C3=A9pa<=
br>
&gt; (litterally, preparation) before you can get into a school.=C2=A0 And =
after that<br>
&gt; pr=C3=A9pa, which is very hard and not fun, a lot of people don&#39;t =
get in.=C2=A0 It&#39;s<br>
&gt; a very frustrating and depressing system.=C2=A0 I chose university, bu=
t it&#39;s not<br>
&gt; very well seen here.=C2=A0 So I don&#39;t recommend France, not for un=
iversity.<br>
&gt; Maybe Scotland, England, Germany, they might be better.=C2=A0 But come=
 to France<br>
&gt; on vacation!=C2=A0 We&#39;d love to have you.=C2=A0 It&#39;s a pretty =
cool country, I just<br>
&gt; think they could do better on the education front.<br>
&gt; What are your plans for the summer?=C2=A0 How was the reunion and the =
spreading<br>
&gt; of the ashes?=C2=A0 I really wish we were there.<br>

&gt; &gt; Sorry this took so long to get back to you, whenever I leave a me=
ssage<br>
&gt; &gt; in my drafts it takes longer to answer and I was only able to fin=
ish<br>
&gt; &gt; part of it when I was back in Maine.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Yeah, Germany and France both have seemed to want Alsace and Lorr=
aine if<br>
&gt; &gt; the history books are to be trusted.=C2=A0 Less sun is often plea=
sant, I<br>
&gt; &gt; would take an overcast day over a sunny one almost any day.=C2=A0=
 Snow is<br>
&gt; &gt; common in Ohio, but it would be exciting if it were as rare as it=
 is in<br>
&gt; &gt; N=C3=AEmes I would imagine.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; College sounds enjoyable.=C2=A0 You don&#39;t really choose most =
of your classes<br>
&gt; &gt; in the US anyway, though you definitely have electives where you =
can<br>
&gt; &gt; take any class you wish.=C2=A0 It&#39;s a shame you don&#39;t get=
 any control over<br>
&gt; &gt; your curriculum in France, but oh well.=C2=A0 On a side-note, sin=
ce college<br>
&gt; &gt; over here is a lot of money (even in-state tuition for a state sc=
hool is<br>
&gt; &gt; not cheap) I&#39;ve started considering applying to universities =
(I guess in<br>
&gt; &gt; France there are Universities and Schools, but I&#39;m mostly ref=
erring to<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;university&quot; in an american sense) outside the US.=C2=
=A0 The money I would be<br>
&gt; &gt; saving on tuition would be spent instead on not starving and all =
the<br>
&gt; &gt; other things you tend to do while going to college.=C2=A0 Are the=
re many<br>
&gt; &gt; students who come from America to France to study?=C2=A0 Which sc=
hools have<br>
&gt; &gt; good computer science programs, and would it be impossible for me=
 to get<br>
&gt; &gt; into them? Are you really the specific person I should be asking =
these<br>
&gt; &gt; things?=C2=A0 If not, don&#39;t worry too much about them.=C2=A0 =
I&#39;m just trying to do<br>
&gt; &gt; a little research into it.=C2=A0 This idea is still pretty recent=
 and I&#39;m in<br>
&gt; &gt; no way set on studying in France or out of the US at all.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Pretty cool taste in music.=C2=A0 I, too, enjoy a bit of everythi=
ng.=C2=A0 Recent<br>
&gt; &gt; favorites include Justice, Phoenix, Daft Punk (always love daft p=
unk,)<br>
&gt; &gt; Deadmau5 had some good stuff, death grips, swans, rush, dream the=
ater,<br>
&gt; &gt; lemaitre, clapton, the list goes on.=C2=A0 Good stuff.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Movies, I am a little less versed in.=C2=A0 I love anything by St=
udio Ghibli<br>
&gt; &gt; (Spirited Away, Howl&#39;s Moving Castle, Nausicaa, etc.) I have =
a thing for<br>
&gt; &gt; Pulp Fiction, but it&#39;s been ages since I watched it.=C2=A0 In=
 all honesty<br>
&gt; &gt; though, I don&#39;t really watch movies as much as I watch anime.=
<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Books are something I need to pay more mind to.=C2=A0 I read a lo=
t, but it<br>
&gt; &gt; tends to be internet stuff and nonfiction.=C2=A0 The hitchhiker&#=
39;s guide to<br>
&gt; &gt; the galaxy books were good.=C2=A0 I liked A Clockwork Orange.=C2=
=A0 That said, I<br>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t read enough to really answer this question properly.<br=
>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Now you answer the questions, but also include favorite TV show a=
nd<br>
&gt; &gt; favorite season.=C2=A0 Call my questions lame if you must, but I =
am curious.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Louise,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It really has been so long.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve been doing we=
ll lately.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Being on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; holiday really gives me time to sleep, which is somethin=
g I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; catch up on after the school year.=C2=A0 It almost could=
 be said<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sleeping<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; too much, though that would not be my claim.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Right now I am in Maine.=C2=A0 Much of the family is her=
e, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; losing games<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of gin to me.=C2=A0 Later today we&#39;re going off to s=
catter the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ashes, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; after that it&#39;s basically that we&#39;re all stuck i=
n Maine for a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; while.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Most of the parents are nostalgic, but in my opinion the=
 only<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; redeeming<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; aspect of this place is the nature=E2=80=94the forests a=
nd the rivers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and such.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Also, our house is pretty big, but that&#39;s mostly jus=
t to deal<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with how<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; many people are staying here.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As far as what I&#39;ve been up to lately, I&#39;ve been=
 doing a good<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; work with computers.=C2=A0 Hopefully soon I&#39;ll have =
work repairing<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; computers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; instead of selling movie tickets, and if my talk gets ac=
