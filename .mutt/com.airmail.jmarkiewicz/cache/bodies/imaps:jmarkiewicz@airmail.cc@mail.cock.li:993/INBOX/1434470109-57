Greetings, John, from CD Baby's Digital Gnomes!

As chance would have it, the download you purchased is one of our clan's
very favorite selections. In fact, all the Digital Gnome parents and
Gnome children, and even some of the older 'Analog' Gnomes, came out to
watch, as your download was prepared. Bit rates were carefully
calibrated, wavelengths measured, and electrons polished with the hems
of our tiny Gnome smocks. (Poor Pixil Gnome was so excited he had to
reboot.)

Once prepared, your digital download was launched into the interweb at
speeds well beyond imagining--shooting through cables, tumbling through
tubes, bouncing off satellites, and landing safely on the banks of your
personal computer.

(Should you have any trouble claiming your download, please consult our
FAQ section HERE <http://www.cdbaby.com/Faq#faq25> .)

Rest assured, your good sense and taste is not lost on the CD Baby
Digital Gnomes!

John, you will be an inspiration to our clan from now until infinity!

Sincerely,

Sir Zero BitSnap, CD Baby's Digital Gnome Emissary
