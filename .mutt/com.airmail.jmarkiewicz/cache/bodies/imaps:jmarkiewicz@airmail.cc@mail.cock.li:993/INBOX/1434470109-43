only confirm receipt of the parcel and no further updates are available.

212555202> )

(1) Skyhill: Run With The Hunted


Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized
contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.

A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it
was in the best possible condition before mailing. Our world-renowned
packing specialist lit a local artisan candle and a hush fell over the
crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can
buy.

We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
Portland waved "Bon Voyage!" to your package, on its way to you, in our
private CD Baby jet on this day, July 16, 2015.

We hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. In commemoration,
we have placed your picture on our wall as "Customer of the Year." We're
all exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Sigh...
We miss you already. We'll be right here at http://cdbaby.com/,
patiently awaiting your return.
