 I feel that my experience singing is crucial to my application because
it is an example of a subject I've felt passionately about,

self-studied, applied, and taken a role of leadership in.

 I've felt strongly about singing since I first performed a solo for an
audience.  In the fifth grade, I sang a solo at a Christmas concert, and
the way it made me feel really pushed me to do more with singing.  The
combination of adrenaline (from performing by myself for the first time)
and the sense of accomplishment was compelling to me, so through the
rest of grade school and high school I sought out opportunities to sing.
 The next experience that really brought me to feel strongly about
singing was the musical my sophomore year.  I joined theater when I
transferred schools, and the musical was the first time I really worked
with a group of people who were as excited and passionate about singing
as I was.  The great thing about singing with a group in general, which
I feel applies especially well to musical theater, is the way emotion
and passion can be conveyed to the audience through music.  This is true
of solo performance as well, but a group of people is often much
stronger because working with a group lends support and energy to all
members.  After performing in this musical, I felt I had to join
Watterson's Concert Choir and A Cappella Choir, where I have had similar
experiences.

 Because of this passion, I have studied singing to a large extent on my
own.  Through my junior year, I was mostly self-taught and often pursued
music outside school and extracurriculars.  Because singing is so
rewarding, I have been driven to become better and practice often; my
love of singing is a powerful source of motivation for self study and
improvement.  I have applied this through my performance with choirs and
in musicals, where I have had the chance to perform with a group for an
audience.  This pattern of studying a skill on my own and then applying
it has come up many times in my life, because for me interest makes me
want to improve.

 This study of and interest in singing has culminated with my leadership
in the projects I am involved in.  In the Watterson Concert Choir I am
now a section leader for the tenors, meaning I help to direct and
improve our sound as part of the choir.  I have performed several solo
parts with the A Cappella Choir, where the best vocalists at Watterson
make up the body of performers.  In addition, I am starting a quartet to
gain experience leading and performing with a smaller group of singers.
