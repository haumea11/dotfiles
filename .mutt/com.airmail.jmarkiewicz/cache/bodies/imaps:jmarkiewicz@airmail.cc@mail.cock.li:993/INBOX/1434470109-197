Hey!

I had a great time in Lyon.  It was only three days, I stayed at a good
friend's place.  She has a new appartment in a really beautiful part of
Lyon and her roomates are cool.  Sometimes I wonder what college would have
been like if had chosen a city where I knew a lot of people.  When I came
to Strasbourg last year, I knew no one.  But that was actually a good
thing, I had to get out of my comfort zone and meet new people.
Let's see, my favorite color is blue.  I think I like blue a little too
much.  My clothes are too blue.  I should try and get stuff that isn't
blue.  Music wise, I played the violin for a long time at the
conservatory.  I quit when I was 16, after a big fight with my teacher.  I
triedto continue alone, and I still play from time to time, but it's not
the same.  At the conservatory, we played in an orchestra for 2 hours a
week, and we had music theory (which I didn't like back then, but actually,
it's very important when you play an instrument).  But I still love it.  I
think it's one of the coolest instruments out there.
I liked the stuff you sent me, I didn't know any of it.  Send more if you
have more!  I will gladly discover new stuff.  last year, I was a volunteer
at a music venue (Paloma was the name).  So I got to see concerts for free
and in exchange, I would work for a few hours behind the bar, or helping at
the snack.  That was fun.  I haven't found anything like that in
Strasbourg.  But it's a good way of seeing concerts without completely
ruining yourself.
Well, my classes have officially all started.  I like it though.  It's fun
beeing back.
I'll try to think of interesting stories, I must have a few.

What's your favorite color?

Love,
Louise

<br>
Don&#39;t worry about a few days here or there.=C2=A0 I&#39;m pretty busy m=
yself as<br>
of late (and it only seems like it&#39;ll get more intense from here) so I<=
br>
can certainly sympathise.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m looking forward to college.=C2=A0 You may wish you had the American=
<br>
experience, but you&#39;re glad you don&#39;t have the American price.=C2=
=A0 It<br>
costs an exorbitant amount of money to go to college most places here,<br>
when it should be free.=C2=A0 We have some backward priorities.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s good to hear you like Momo.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve thought of naming my co=
mputer<br>
(and guitars, and other possessions) but I never seem to come up with<br>
anything.<br>
<br>
Recommendations for music, let&#39;s see...=C2=A0 I have a few songs worth =
your<br>
time, and if you like them you may like their artists.=C2=A0 &quot;Trains&q=
uot; by<br>
Porcupine Tree is a fantastic song, as is &quot;Cut to Black&quot; by Lemai=
tre<br>
(named for the scientist, but at some point they dropped the<br>
circonflexe in the band name.)=C2=A0 For (more) electronic stuff I like<br>
Justice (&quot;New Lands&quot; and &quot;Helix&quot; come to mind) and Zero=
 7 (I love so<br>
much of their work but a good place to start would be &quot;Salt Water<br>
Sound.&quot;)=C2=A0 If you like Zero 7, then Air and Skyhill are further<br=
>
listening worth your time.<br>
<br>
Also, if you&#39;re looking for weirder stuff, Swans&#39; album &quot;To Be=
 Kind&quot;<br>
is a great album, if a bit hard to get used to for most listeners.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ll stop with the music recommendations before I get too carried<br>
away.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know much of anything about Lyon, I hope you had a good time<br=

there with your friends.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll have to make a note to look it up,<=
br>
since I think it&#39;s a nice thing to know about the places in the world.<=
br>
<br>
Let&#39;s see, interesting stories.=C2=A0 Let me quote you one from another=
<br>
e-mail I recently sent (Context is that I&#39;m no longer dating the girl<b=
r>
mentioned in the story.)<br>
<br>
2015-07-22 22:04 GMT+02:00 John Markiewicz &lt;jmarkiewicz@airmail.cc&gt;:<=
br>
<br>
&gt; I was coming home from hanging out with some friends of mine, and my m=
other<br>
&gt; is furious.=C2=A0 She doesn&#39;t say why, but I can tell she&#39;s be=
yond livid.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt; finally get from her why she&#39;s mad, and she accuses me of having s=
ex with<br>
&gt; my girlfriend in my parents&#39; bed.=C2=A0 I hadn&#39;t had sex with =
this girl at all,<br>
&gt; let alone in my parents&#39; bed, so you can understand why I would be=
 shocked<br>
&gt; and confused.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I respond by asking &quot;Why the hell would I do that, and why would =
you think<br>
&gt; I would do that?&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; She said back to me &quot;Well, I found women&#39;s underwear in my be=
d, and they&#39;re<br>
&gt; definitely not my underwear.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We argue back and forth for a while, because earlier in the weekend I =
had<br>
&gt; done laundry and there was a pair of underwear at the bottom of my bas=
ket<br>
&gt; that I had casually assumed were my mothers and I set them on her bed.=
=C2=A0 She<br>
&gt; ends up yelling at me to go look at the underwear, and about how obvio=
usly<br>
&gt; they couldn&#39;t have been her underwear.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Now, I don&#39;t know how most people would react to a strange pair of=
 panties<br>
&gt; just sitting at the bottom of their laundry basket, but I just thought=
 &quot;I<br>
&gt; don&#39;t know whose these are, and the only woman living in this hous=
e is my<br>
&gt; mother.&quot;=C2=A0 In retrospect, they were definitely not her sort o=
f underwear,<br>
&gt; though in fairness my girlfriend of the time wouldn&#39;t be caught we=
aring a<br>
&gt; leopard-print thong either.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I go up, and on the band of the underwear is an orange cat hair.=C2=A0=
 At this<br>
&gt; point, everything makes sense.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; At the time, we had been letting my cousin do laundry at our place whi=
le<br>
&gt; she was getting on her feet.=C2=A0 She had just moved in from Maine, a=
nd she<br>
&gt; owned an orange cat.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I wish I had had a camera to take a picture of the face my mom made wh=
en<br>
&gt; she realized I was telling the truth and she had just yelled at me for=
<br>
&gt; three hours at 9 in the morning for no reason.=C2=A0 That single momen=
t may have<br>
&gt; been the biggest &quot;I told you so&quot; in my whole life.<br>
<br>
Hopefully the formatting on that went alright.=C2=A0 If that poses an<br>
issue, I can just as easily drop the quotation formatting.=C2=A0 I always<b=
r>
write these e-mails in plaintext, so I never know how they&#39;ll look in<b=
r>
a non-monospaced font in a different mailclient.=C2=A0 Programmers are<br>
pretty specific about their computer setup, and I guess in some sense<br>
I&#39;m a bit of a programmer.<br>
<br>
The people at my school (at least, the ones I associate with anymore,<br>
I can give details on what I mean if you especially fancy hearing<br>
about stupid teenager drama that happened a year ago and doesn&#39;t even<b=
r>
matter anymore) are pretty cool.=C2=A0 The people I generally hang around<b=
r>
with like computers, theatre, singing, or some combination of those.<br>
There are exceptions, but it&#39;s often very easy to become friends with<b=
r>
people you share interests with.=C2=A0 I&#39;m glad to have the friends I h=
ave.<br>
<br>
Well, how about you?=C2=A0 Do you have an interesting story to tell me?=C2=
=A0 I<br>
might have a fresher one next time, but I can&#39;t promise anything.=C2=A0=
 I<br>
would include another story here but if I did so it might slow me down<br>
in sending this e-mail.<br>
<br>
Are you involved in anything musically?=C2=A0 That is to say, singing or<br=
>
playing an instrument.<br>
<br>
Do you have a favorite color?=C2=A0 I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t asked=
 it yet<br>
and I like to include a silly question from time to time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I&#39;d best be off before it gets terribly late.=C2=A0 I have scho=
ol<br>
tomorrow, and I&#39;m beginning to get tired.<br>
<br>
Best Wishes,<br>

&gt; &gt; good to hear you already have a job lined up, especially one abro=
ad<br>
&gt; &gt; with family.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As far as my classes go, I&#39;m taking a lot of AP (Advanced Pla=
cement, a<br>
&gt; &gt; way to get college credit while still trapped in the never-ending=
<br>
&gt; &gt; prison sentence that is high school) classes.=C2=A0 My favorite i=

&gt; &gt; AP English, which is taught by a very old nun.=C2=A0 She&#39;s hi=

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m excited to improve my writing (which I think needs to hap=
pen,<br>
&gt; &gt; since so far my schooling has done a pretty mediocre job of teach=
ing<br>
&gt; &gt; me to write so far.)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I probably should start applying soon, but I still have a couple<=
br>
&gt; &gt; months before it&#39;s crucial.=C2=A0 Probably going to apply to =
a few<br>
&gt; &gt; colleges, even though I&#39;m sort of set on one already.=C2=A0 F=
un thing about<br>
&gt; &gt; college applications is how much advertising they&#39;ve been sen=

&gt; &gt; in the mail; even MIT have sent me a package of information askin=

&gt; &gt; to apply.=C2=A0 Not going to MIT, though, since they don&#39;t of=
fer academic<br>
&gt; &gt; scholarships and I don&#39;t have that sort of money.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I also hope I get to see you soon, though it&#39;s pretty much gu=
aranteed<br>
&gt; &gt; that it won&#39;t be for several months here.=C2=A0 I feel like i=

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Heard any albums that caught your attention lately?=C2=A0 Either =
in a good<br>
&gt; &gt; way or in an interesting way (or both?)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Also, you&#39;ll have to indulge me by answering a question you&#=

&gt; &gt; see as silly.=C2=A0 Do you own a computer?=C2=A0 What sort of com=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I had thought I responded to this e-mail, but I m=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Really sorry about that.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let&#39;s see.=C2=A0 For TV shows (I&#39;ll admit, I do=
n&#39;t watch terribly many) I<br>
&gt; &gt; tend<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to watch a lot of anime.=C2=A0 Off the top of my head I=
 also enjoyed Archer<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Louie C.K.&#39;s show.=C2=A0 I enjoy quite a few, but I=
 mostly watch TV in<br>
&gt; &gt; passing<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather than as a focused event these days.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as books go, I recently read &quot;Left to Tell,=
&quot; which was good if<br>
&gt; &gt; a bit<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heavy on the religion at some points, and will soon be =
starting<br>
&gt; &gt; Beowulf for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school.=C2=A0 There are also a couple less interesting =
titles on Systems<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Administration I&#39;m reading through these days.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps college either here in the states or Germany, t=
hen.<br>
&gt; &gt; Regardless, I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really need to visit you guys.=C2=A0 I had taken a litt=
le French last year<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (though the teacher was kind of terrible) but have move=
d since to<br>
&gt; &gt; picking<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up the language on my own, so that may be useful.=C2=A0=
 I&#39;m still not<br>
&gt; &gt; terribly<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good, as you would quickly realize if I had to write a =
passage without<br>
&gt; &gt; a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; French-English dictionary handy.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since there was such an unintentional gap between the l=
etters, I<br>
&gt; &gt; suppose<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll do a recap of what happened over the summer.=
=C2=A0 I did very little,<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came to terms with another year of high school.=C2=A0 I=
 don&#39;t especially<br>
&gt; &gt; fancy<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; High School, and have hopes that College will be at the=
 very least more<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interesting.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The scattering of the ashes went well.=C2=A0 I suppose =
having a ceremony<br>
&gt; &gt; around<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it seems a little contrary to how Mike would have gone =
about it, but I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think the whole thing was more for the survivors than a=
nything else,<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trip was fairly nice.=C2=A0 We were glad to have Li=
z and Baz, who are<br>
&gt; &gt; always<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really chill.=C2=A0 We were sad you and Sophie couldn&#=
39;t be at the thing in<br>
&gt; &gt; Maine<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (or at least, I was.=C2=A0 I didn&#39;t go around polli=
ng people.)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, now my final year of High school has started.=
=C2=A0 I&#39;m taking a<br>
&gt; &gt; tough<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; courseload this year, but I think I can handle it.=C2=
=A0 It&#39;s not as though<br>
&gt; &gt; the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; American school system teaches anything difficult in hi=
gh school, it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply a matter of how much of the stuff you&#39;re dea=
ling with at once.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anything interesting happen in your life during that ga=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>

 to leave this<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like that.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, well I love movies.=C2=A0 I also have a thing =
for pulp fiction, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarantino&#39;s films in general.=C2=A0 They&#39;r=

&gt; &gt; them are<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really good.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know Studio Ghibli,=
 I&#39;ll check it out.=C2=A0 We<br>
&gt; &gt; have so<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many movies here.=C2=A0 I always love Harry Potter=
 and the Lord of the<br>
&gt; &gt; Rings.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Classics...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For TV shows, I really like 30 rock, scrubs, Game =
of thrones, chuck.<br>
&gt; &gt; How I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; met your mother and Big bang theory are pretty goo=
d too. It&#39;s so<br>
&gt; &gt; addictive<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though!=C2=A0 What about you?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now books, I&#39;m reading &#39;He named me Malala=
&quot;.=C2=A0 I also loved the<br>
&gt; &gt; Hitchhiker&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guide, I had like a little obsession with douglas =
adams and read all<br>
&gt; &gt; his<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; books.=C2=A0 a couple years ago.=C2=A0 I love read=
ing.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, for schools in France, it&#39;s a little com=
plicated.=C2=A0 You need to<br>
&gt; &gt; do a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two year program after high school (after the BAC)=
, called pr=C3=A9pa<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (litterally, preparation) before you can get into =
a school.=C2=A0 And<br>
&gt; &gt; after that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pr=C3=A9pa, which is very hard and not fun, a lot =
of people don&#39;t get<br>
&gt; &gt; in.=C2=A0 It&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a very frustrating and depressing system.=C2=A0 I =

&gt; &gt; it&#39;s not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very well seen here.=C2=A0 So I don&#39;t recommen=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe Scotland, England, Germany, they might be be=

=A0 It&#39;s a pretty cool country, I<br>
&gt; &gt; just<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think they could do better on the education front.=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part of it when I was back in Maine.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, Germany and France both have seemed to =

&gt; &gt; over<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your curriculum in France, but oh well.=C2=A0=
 On a side-note, since<br>
&gt; &gt; college<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a little research into it.=C2=A0 This idea is=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Books are something I need to pay more mind t=

&gt; &gt; it<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has set classes.=C2=A0 I think it&#39;s =
too bad, but oh well...=C2=A0 But<br>
&gt; &gt; appart<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from that, Strasbourg is great, and I lo=
ve what I&#39;m studying.<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to try to spend a year in Montreal=
 next year, as an<br>
&gt; &gt; exchange<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; student, and for my masters (maybe neuro=
science), I&#39;m definitely<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to try moving to the US.=C2=A0 I d=
o wish I could have the<br>
&gt; &gt; American<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; college experience.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ohio State, that&#39;s awesome.=C2=A0 I =
remember loving the campus!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let&#39;s see, I love the Clash, the Bla=
ck keys, phoenix, the Cure.<br>
&gt; &gt; I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; studied jazz last year and really got in=
to bill evans and miles<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; davis (cool jazz).=C2=A0 I like some rap=
.=C2=A0 I tend to like old music<br>
&gt; &gt; too,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like Ray Charles, Nina Simone.=C2=A0 I l=
ike all sorts of music.=C2=A0 Iwas<br>
&gt; &gt; a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; volunteer at a music venue last year, so=
 I got to see all sorts<br>
&gt; &gt; of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerts, in exchange for a few hours of=
 work.=C2=A0 That was really<br>
&gt; &gt; cool.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And you?=C2=A0 What movies do you like t=
oo?=C2=A0 And books?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope you&#39;re having fun in Maine, Tak=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, computers are fun, though it&#39;s=
 hard to be too interested in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them if they don&#39;t work well for you=
.=C2=A0 I&#39;m glad, since I seem to<br>
&gt; &gt; have<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a knack for them.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s not a bad time to spend (too mu=
ch) a lot of time sleeping.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s how all the cool people pass th=
e morning, if they have the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chance. Especially in the summer.=C2=A0 =
30=C2=B0C sounds horrible and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweltering, even if there&#39;s not terr=
ible humidity, so I would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably try to only be up at night give=
n the chance.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s good to hear things are going w=
ell.=C2=A0 Strasbourg is in<br>
&gt; &gt; Alsace,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right?=C2=A0 That really is close to Ger=
many.=C2=A0 I&#39;d love to come to<br>
&gt; &gt; France<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at some point, but unless I can catch a =
plane over then I can&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; summer.=C2=A0 Here&#39;s to hoping, but =
I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything. How&#39;s college treating you=
?=C2=A0 What are you studying?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am a senior next year (and looking for=
ward to not being in high<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school after that.)=C2=A0 I&#39;m pretty=
 sure I&#39;m going to the Ohio State<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University, since they&#39;re close and =
cheap and have a great<br>
&gt; &gt; computer<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; science program. I would rather the deci=
sion not be so heavily<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; influenced by tuition rates, but unless =
I can get a full ride or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something it just plain doesn&#39;t make=
 sense for me to go anywhere<br>
&gt; &gt; out<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the state.=C2=A0 So, I guess, I thoug=
ht about colleges and now I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty sure where I&#39;m going.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wow, that sounds great.=C2=A0 I&#39;=

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; always impressed with people who are=
. I&#39;ve been on vacation for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; over a month now, and I also spend a=
 lot of (too much?) time<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sleeping.=C2=A0 But it&#39;s so hot =
here there&#39;s not much else to do. It<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; gets to more than 30=C2=B0C which is=
 about 90=C2=B0F I think.=C2=A0 You truly<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can&#39;t do much. Life has been goo=
d.=C2=A0 I moved to Strasbourg last<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; August, for college. It&#39;s a real=
ly beautiful city.=C2=A0 It&#39;s like 15<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; minutes away from Germany. If you co=
me to France, you can come<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; crash on my couch.=C2=A0 I&#39;m bac=
k in N=C3=AEmes for the summer, it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; pretty<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; strange being back here. You&#39;re =
a senior next year, right?=C2=A0 Are<br>
&gt; &gt; you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thinking of colleges yet? Love, Loui=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Louise,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It really has been so long.=C2=A0 I&=
#39;ve been doing well lately.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; holiday really gives me time to slee=
p, which is something I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; catch up on after the school year.=
=C2=A0 It almost could be said<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sleeping<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; too much, though that would not be m=
y claim.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Right now I am in Maine.=C2=A0 Much =
of the family is here, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; losing games<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of gin to me.=C2=A0 Later today we&#=
39;re going off to scatter the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ashes, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; after that it&#39;s basically that w=
e&#39;re all stuck in Maine for a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Most of the parents are nostalgic, b=
ut in my opinion the only<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; redeeming<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; aspect of this place is the nature=
=E2=80=94the forests and the rivers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and such.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Also, our house is pretty big, but t=
hat&#39;s mostly just to deal<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with how<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; many people are staying here.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As far as what I&#39;ve been up to l=
ately, I&#39;ve been doing a good<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; work with computers.=C2=A0 Hopefully=
 soon I&#39;ll have work repairing<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; instead of selling movie tickets, an=
d if my talk gets accepted<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; speaking at a conference later this =
summer (as I was writing<br>
&gt; &gt; this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; e-mail, I was informed in another e-=
mail that my talk would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; make it on to the schedule, but I ha=
ve plenty of other things<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to attend<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to anyway.)=C2=A0 That would be pret=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; How has life been for you?<br>
