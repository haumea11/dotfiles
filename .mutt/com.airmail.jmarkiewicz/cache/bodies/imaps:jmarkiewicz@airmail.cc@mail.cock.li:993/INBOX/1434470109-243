Hello Concert Choir Families,

This is the first Choir update I've sent this school year. Just a few
things to bring you up to date with for this month.

1. All final packages of new uniforms were shipped this week, which means
all uniforms should be sorted and given to students hopefully by the end of
next week. This should allow time for any alterations that need to be made
before the Eagle Auction on Oct. 31st.
If alterations are made, please do your best to not cut any fabric off
since uniforms are reused by other students.

2. Our first fundraiser started on Thursday and runs until Oct. 15th. This
is the Just Pies Gift Certificate Fundraiser. Information was passed out in
class but is also available on Brain Honey under Course Resources. Students
are encouraged to try to sell at least one Just Pies Gift Certificate for
either a $10 or $20 amount. Just Pies has three locations and has over 35
different varieties of pies available, homemade daily. With Thanksgiving
and Christmas just around the corner, this is the perfect time to plan
ahead for those family meals. Gift Certificates never expire and do not
have to be used all at once. This fundraiser is not mandatory and students
will also be selling Poinsettias in November. If your family would rather
support the choir through Christmas Decor purchases, that is understood.
If you have any questions regarding the Just Pies sale, please contact
myself, Rhoda Anglim (ranglim@columbus.rr.com) or Denise Golonka (
deniseg0328@yahoo.com)

3. Students have the opportunity to show their Choir/Handbell Department
Pride and earn 10 Pts. extra credit by working at 30 minute shift at the
Fall Festival next Wednesday between 6-8. The Choral Department will be
selling White Castle Slides and Smoothie King Smoothies!

4. The Concert Choir will be performing at the Eagle Auction on Oct. 31st.
I have not received a performance time, but I am expecting it to be around
6-7pm. I will try to make this performance as short as possible for
students since they will be performing the next day as well. You must have
a ticket to the event in order to watch the students sing.

5. The Concert Choir will be performing Faure's Requiem at Our Lady of
Peace Church on Sunday, Nov. 1st at 2pm. This is a wonderful opportunity
for student to perform a well known large-work. More information will be
sent out soon.

6. If you have any tea themed items (towels, pots, spoons, sugar, honey,
etc.) The choir will be donating a basket of tea to the Eagle Auction. We
currently have plenty of tea flavors. Please send in items this next week
if you have something to donate.

7. I hope you have had the chance to see a few of the video posted on the
Choir's Twitter account. So fair they've only featured the handbell
classes, but choir ones will begin to come out soon as songs are beginning
to be memorized! It is a great way to see the progress your students are
making.

Have a great fall weekend!
