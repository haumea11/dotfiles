Hello Choir Families!

The last month of school is upon us and that means that we have a busy
upcoming schedule of end of the year events. Please read through the
following information carefully to make sure that you're up to date!

*Upcoming Events:*

1. Saturday, May 7th - 6:30-7:30pm - Members of the Mixed Choir will sing
at First Community Lutheran Church on Morse Rd. for their Springtime
Celebration of Life Gala. We sing for this event twice a year and often
receive recognition from the Mayor for our contribution. Dinner will be
provided to the students. It is not mandatory because of prom. Students
attending will wear their choir uniform

2. Wednesday, May 11th - 7-8pm in the Choir Room - Parents and Students who
will be in Concert Choir next year are invited to attend this meeting to
discuss the details of next year's trip to Washington DC. I will use this
meeting to decide if this trip will happen and get an idea of what sights
we might want to see.

3. Monday, May 16th - 3:30-5pm Choir Concert Rehearsal in Old Gym - All
students must attend this rehearsal as it is our only time to run through
the songs as a group and with the pianist. Any absences must be accompied
by a signed parent note.

4. Monday, May 16th - 6:30-8:30pm - Gold Standard will sing at the Mother's
Club Induction Service in Watterson's Chapel. They are to wear nice Spring
church clothes. Dinner will be provided.

5. Tuesday, May 17th - 7pm Spring Choir Concert in Old Gym - All students
are required to attend this concert. Any guests are welcome to join us for
this fun end of the year event. See what your students have been working on
all semester! Students will wear their assigned choir uniform. Each grade
will be assigned an item to bring for the cookie reception following the
concert.

6. Wednesday, May 18th - Gradeschool Music Tour during School Day - The
Mixed and Concert Choirs will be traveling to the gradeschools to perform.
They will be absent the entire school day. This is not a required event
since it does require missing school. Students will need to tell me if they
are staying at school.

7. Thursday, May 19th - 7pm Senior Spotlight in Theatre - All seniors are
invited to perform a solo song of their choosing. This year's concert is
held in the theatre. Seniors are to wear nice spring church clothes. There
will be a cookie and punch reception afterwards.

*Volunteer Opportunity:*
I am in need of 2 or 3 Sophomore or Junior parents who would be willing to
set up the cookie and punch reception in the cafeteria during the Senior
Spotlight concert. I will provide the materials needed to make the punch.
I also need a few punch bowls!

*Choir Photos:*
If anyone has good pictures of the choir students from this year's events,
please feel free to send them my way. The yearbook is looking for pictures.

Let me know if you have any questions! This month is going to fly by!

*Choral Director*
