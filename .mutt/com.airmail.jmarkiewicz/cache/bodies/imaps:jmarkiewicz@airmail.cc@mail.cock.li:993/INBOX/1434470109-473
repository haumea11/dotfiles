Hi cock.li,

Your favorite E-mail server received its third subpoena today. Did you
know subpoenas really suck and when people abuse cock.li it takes time
that I could have spent masturbating or doing something productive and
turn it into time spent doing paperwork? This time it was by a state
police department and the FBI, and the whole thing sucked a bit more
than usual. I publish every request I get for user information, phone
call recordings included. You can read and listen to it here:

https://cock.li/transparency/2015-12-09-subpoena/

Today I opened a "personal" BTC address that people can send donations
that fund the time that I spend on the site personally. For those that
do not know, the finances of cock.li are designed so that I do not make
a single cent off of the site. That leaves me out of any commercial
interest in the site, but it also means that I'm spending an
increasingly burdonsome amount of time fixing issues and dealing with
the fucking feds.

For those that are willing and able to contribute financially, my
personal BTC address is here:

1PPYPy3e55z76LQGq7UkLttHomkbXGHcqg

This setup means that cock.li's finances will still be managed as it has
been, but people who want to contribute to me personally for the work I
do on this site now have a way to do so.

You'll never get a stupid money grabbing E-mail like this again. In the
meantime, I'm a huge faggot please shoot giant loads of internet meme
money on my face.

Also stop abusing cock.li pls
