Hi John,

     Yes, I'd be happy to write you a recommendation in the next few days.

We need something in Italian. I don't think we have anything do we?

Au bord du l'eau Faure
Black Is the Color John Jacob niles
When I was young and twenty butterworth
Come away death quilter

Is this rep list accurate?

We need a Caccini or Bononcini monody. And we should grow more early music r=
ep.=20

If you can meet sometime tomorrow afternoon (right after school) that would b=
e great. I'll do something thinking about rep and write an email later this e=
vening with some suggestions.

Thanks,
Nathan=20

Hey Mr. Medley,

Since December 1st is approaching rapidly, and it seems that's the day
music programs expect applications in, and some of them are expecting
a prescreening, I figured I should probably ask your advice on it.  I
don't know if you got my text yesterday, but I'll be out of town
Wednesday (which I know makes things difficult) and won't be back
until Friday.

I'm really sorry to request this on such short notice, but if I could
get a recommendation from you for the purposes of applying to colleges
before the first that would be fantastic.  I wish I could have started
this process earlier, but I first e-mailed you about it only a few
hours after I began to think about declaring a major in a field other
than Comp. Sci.

Which two pieces that I currently have do you think I should focus on
for prescreening?

Best Wishes,
John Markiewicz
