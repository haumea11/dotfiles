Hey,

Sorry, it's been a few days.  My classes have started, so I'm slowly
getting back in the rythm, while still crashing on my friend's couch.  But,
after 4 months of vacation, it's actually really cool.  I have so much
chemestry, like 12 credits, and math and, of course, biology (immunology,
developmental bio, cellular bio...).  I have thermochem tomorrow morning,
followed by plant biology.  And then I don't have anything until monday.
But I'll have quite a lot of classes this year, this week is light because
it's the first.
It's all very interesting.  And changing classes every semester is not
bad.  I think you'll like college.  I also didn't like high school that
much, even though I have kept a lot of close friends from then.  But
college is awesome.  I wish I had the american experience, but the french
one is cool.
Yes, I have a computer.  It's an ASUS.  I call it Momo.  I'm not that good
with computers (or thechnology actually), I couldn't tell you more.  I like
it!
Let's see, music wise, I've just been listening to the same stuff : the
smiths, david bowie...  I should try to find new stuff.  Have you heard
something interesting?  Anything you would recommand?
I'm going to Lyon tomorrow night, to go see friends before my classes start
taking up all my time.  I don't know if you know it, but it's a really nice
city.
Now how about you, do you have any interesting stories to tell me?  How are
the people at your school?
Love,
Louise

<br>
It&#39;s good to hear you&#39;re moving into an apartment!=C2=A0 I have to =
say, I&#39;m<br>
a little jealous, since if my college goes according to plan I&#39;m<br>
unlikely to move out for another couple of years.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t really<=
br>
fancy living at home, but I like debt even less, and my parents are<br>
chill enough that I can deal with it.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s nice to hear that you feel prepared for your classes.=C2=A0 I hope=
<br>
they go well.=C2=A0 What does your courseload look like this year?=C2=A0 It=
&#39;s<br>
good to hear you already have a job lined up, especially one abroad<br>
with family.<br>
<br>
As far as my classes go, I&#39;m taking a lot of AP (Advanced Placement, a<=
br>
way to get college credit while still trapped in the never-ending<br>
prison sentence that is high school) classes.=C2=A0 My favorite is probably=
<br>
AP English, which is taught by a very old nun.=C2=A0 She&#39;s hilarious an=
d<br>
I&#39;m excited to improve my writing (which I think needs to happen,<br>
since so far my schooling has done a pretty mediocre job of teaching<br>
me to write so far.)<br>
<br>
I probably should start applying soon, but I still have a couple<br>
months before it&#39;s crucial.=C2=A0 Probably going to apply to a few<br>
colleges, even though I&#39;m sort of set on one already.=C2=A0 Fun thing a=
bout<br>
college applications is how much advertising they&#39;ve been sending me<br=
>
in the mail; even MIT have sent me a package of information asking me<br>
to apply.=C2=A0 Not going to MIT, though, since they don&#39;t offer academ=
ic<br>
scholarships and I don&#39;t have that sort of money.<br>
<br>
I also hope I get to see you soon, though it&#39;s pretty much guaranteed<b=
r>
that it won&#39;t be for several months here.=C2=A0 I feel like if I were t=
o<br>
spend time overseas I&#39;d want a bare minimum of a couple weeks, which I<=
br>
can&#39;t really afford during school even with the breaks I get.<br>
<br>
Heard any albums that caught your attention lately?=C2=A0 Either in a good<=
br>
way or in an interesting way (or both?)<br>
<br>
Also, you&#39;ll have to indulge me by answering a question you&#39;ll like=

see as silly.=C2=A0 Do you own a computer?=C2=A0 What sort of computer is i=
t?<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Well, I had thought I responded to this e-mail, but I must not ha=
ve.<br>
&gt; &gt; Really sorry about that.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s see.=C2=A0 For TV shows (I&#39;ll admit, I don&#39;t wa=
tch terribly many) I tend<br>
&gt; &gt; to watch a lot of anime.=C2=A0 Off the top of my head I also enjo=
yed Archer and<br>
&gt; &gt; Louie C.K.&#39;s show.=C2=A0 I enjoy quite a few, but I mostly wa=
tch TV in passing<br>
&gt; &gt; rather than as a focused event these days.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As far as books go, I recently read &quot;Left to Tell,&quot; whi=
ch was good if a bit<br>
&gt; &gt; heavy on the religion at some points, and will soon be starting B=
eowulf for<br>
&gt; &gt; school.=C2=A0 There are also a couple less interesting titles on =
Systems<br>
&gt; &gt; Administration I&#39;m reading through these days.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps college either here in the states or Germany, then.=C2=A0=
 Regardless, I<br>
&gt; &gt; really need to visit you guys.=C2=A0 I had taken a little French =
last year<br>
&gt; &gt; (though the teacher was kind of terrible) but have moved since to=
 picking<br>
&gt; &gt; up the language on my own, so that may be useful.=C2=A0 I&#39;m s=
till not terribly<br>
&gt; &gt; good, as you would quickly realize if I had to write a passage wi=
thout a<br>
&gt; &gt; French-English dictionary handy.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Since there was such an unintentional gap between the letters, I =
suppose<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll do a recap of what happened over the summer.=C2=A0 I did=
 very little, and<br>
&gt; &gt; came to terms with another year of high school.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t=
 especially fancy<br>
&gt; &gt; High School, and have hopes that College will be at the very leas=
t more<br>
&gt; &gt; interesting.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The scattering of the ashes went well.=C2=A0 I suppose having a c=
eremony around<br>
&gt; &gt; it seems a little contrary to how Mike would have gone about it, =
but I<br>
&gt; &gt; think the whole thing was more for the survivors than anything el=
se, and<br>
&gt; &gt; the trip was fairly nice.=C2=A0 We were glad to have Liz and Baz,=
 who are always<br>
&gt; &gt; really chill.=C2=A0 We were sad you and Sophie couldn&#39;t be at=
 the thing in Maine<br>
&gt; &gt; (or at least, I was.=C2=A0 I didn&#39;t go around polling people.=
)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, now my final year of High school has started.=C2=A0 I&#39=
;m taking a tough<br>
&gt; &gt; courseload this year, but I think I can handle it.=C2=A0 It&#39;s=
 not as though the<br>
&gt; &gt; American school system teaches anything difficult in high school,=
 it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; simply a matter of how much of the stuff you&#39;re dealing with =
at once.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Anything interesting happen in your life during that gap?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Best Wishes,<br>
&gt; &gt; John<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; P.S. I really am sorry about the gap, I didn&#39;t mean to leave =
this hanging<br>
&gt; &gt; like that.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the history books are to be trusted.=C2=A0 Less sun is =

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, I don&#39;t really watch movies as much as I wa=
tch anime.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Books are something I need to pay more mind to.=C2=A0 I=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s not a bad time to spend (too much) a lot =
of time sleeping.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s how all the cool people pass the morning,=
 if they have the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chance. Especially in the summer.=C2=A0 30=C2=B0C =
sounds horrible and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweltering, even if there&#39;s not terrible humid=
ity, so I would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably try to only be up at night given the chan=
ce.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s good to hear things are going well.=C2=A0=
 Strasbourg is in Alsace,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right?=C2=A0 That really is close to Germany.=C2=
=A0 I&#39;d love to come to France<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at some point, but unless I can catch a plane over=
 then I can&#39;t this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; summer.=C2=A0 Here&#39;s to hoping, but I wouldn&#=
39;t hold my breath or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything. How&#39;s college treating you?=C2=A0 Wh=
at are you studying?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am a senior next year (and looking forward to no=
t being in high<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school after that.)=C2=A0 I&#39;m pretty sure I&#3=
9;m going to the Ohio State<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University, since they&#39;re close and cheap and =
have a great computer<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; science program. I would rather the decision not b=
e so heavily<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; influenced by tuition rates, but unless I can get =
a full ride or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something it just plain doesn&#39;t make sense for=
 me to go anywhere out<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the state.=C2=A0 So, I guess, I thought about c=
olleges and now I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty sure where I&#39;m going.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What sort of music have you been into lately?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best Wishes, John<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Louise,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It really has been so long.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve bee=
n doing well lately.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; holiday really gives me time to sleep, which i=
s something I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; catch up on after the school year.=C2=A0 It al=
most could be said<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sleeping<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; too much, though that would not be my claim.<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Right now I am in Maine.=C2=A0 Much of the fam=
ily is here, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; losing games<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of gin to me.=C2=A0 Later today we&#39;re goin=
g off to scatter the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ashes, and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; after that it&#39;s basically that we&#39;re a=
ll stuck in Maine for a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Most of the parents are nostalgic, but in my o=
pinion the only<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; redeeming<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; aspect of this place is the nature=E2=80=94the=
 forests and the rivers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and such.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Also, our house is pretty big, but that&#39;s =
mostly just to deal<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with how<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; many people are staying here.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As far as what I&#39;ve been up to lately, I&#=
39;ve been doing a good<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; work with computers.=C2=A0 Hopefully soon I&#3=
9;ll have work repairing<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; instead of selling movie tickets, and if my ta=
lk gets accepted<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; speaking at a conference later this summer (as=
 I was writing this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; e-mail, I was informed in another e-mail that =
my talk would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; make it on to the schedule, but I have plenty =
of other things<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to attend<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to anyway.)=C2=A0 That would be pretty cool.<b=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; How has life been for you?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
