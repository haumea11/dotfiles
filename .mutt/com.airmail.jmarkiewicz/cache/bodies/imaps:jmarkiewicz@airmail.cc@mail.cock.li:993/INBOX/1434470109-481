Hello Choir Families,

Thank you for the many compliments after last Thursday's concert. I am so
proud of the students and how well they performed. They have worked very
hard this semester and their efforts showed. I am very thankful to work in
such a supportive environment with families and students who appreciate the
value of an arts education. What a gift!

Just a few reminders before Christmas Break:
1. Our December Booster meeting is being held tomorrow at 7pm in the Choir
Room. We will be discussing the poinsettia sale and the concert as well as
making plans for the upcoming semester. Just a reminder that we are looking
for two people to take over the positions of Vice-President and Spirit
Night Chair. We like to have these positions filled before the end of the
year so that the current officers can show you the ropes.

2. Set your DVR to record NBC 4's "Columbus Sings" program at 6am on
Christmas Morning. There's a chance that parts of the choir concert will
appear!

3. If you provided a tray of cookies, I might have your plate! I have a red
plastic plate with a snowman on it, a metal tray with two snowmen on it,
and a clear glass plate with Christmas tree on it. Please let me know who I
need to send these items home with!

4. The choirs have been asked to give a 30 minute performance at the end of
the school day on Friday following the prayer service. If your student is
available, please encourage them to come to school so that we can have a
good performance. I know it's a very short day of school, but many classes
offer extra credit opportunities this day!

5. Students who are available will be performing at State Auto's Nativity
on Friday Evening. I will be taking a survey of who is attending on Friday.
Students are asked to dress warmly for this event, no uniform is required.
Parking is available on the north side of the building at 518 East Broad
St. We will begin performing at 7pm so please arrive at 6:45 and meet at
the main entrance of the building. Student will be finished by 7:45. I will
send out another email on Friday to give the details again.

6. If your child takes private lessons for voice, piano, or a stringed
instrument and would like to participate in OMEA Solo and Ensemble
competition in February. Please have them see me to register. Registration
materials and fees are due January 16th.

7. Auditions for the Spring Musical "Bye Bye Birdie" begin on Sunday,
January 3rd and continue that first week back from break. There are many
different roles for different amounts of availability. If your child plays
a spring sport, but would like to be in the musical, we can make it work!
All students must audition (even for a chorus role) because we need to know
that they are willing to try, however no one is turned away. All students
will be asked to sing a prepared segment of a song and read from a scene as
well as learn a short dance combination.
Please have your student sign-up for an audition time using Sign-up Genius
on bwmusical.weebly.com or talk to Miss Joyce.
