Hey John,
=20
Thanks, Corsica was great!

Since there has been an update in my life recently (that doesn't happen ofte=
n)
I'll inform you of it: I broke up with my girlfriend, and the feeling (or la=
ck of feeling)
Was mutual, so I'm glad there was no meltdown.

Nope, there's no bacon in N=C3=AEmes...=20

Getting alcohol in France is as easy as buying bread. Seriously, you can wal=
k=20
Into a supermarket and ask for alcohol, and unless you look like a twelve-ye=
ar-old,
They usually won't ask for your ID.=20
Otherwise you can just walk into a bar and ask for whatever you want, not on=
ce=20
have I seen someone getting their ID checked in a bar.

My opinion on the effects of alcohol? I guess it can be fun if you're kind o=
f shy
And need a nudge to loosen up or if you like the state it puts you in (which=
 depends
On the person, in my case, it just makes me laugh hysterically at everything=

And say stupid things). But of course you need to drink with moderation othe=
rwise
The effects are dreadful.

That's an awesome story! Your parents must have found it pretty damn funny.

Well I have some stories about fighting for bathrooms in restaurants, at oth=
er people's
Houses, or during stomach flue epidemics (we catch it every time, and with f=
ive people
And only two bathrooms in the house, it gets complicated very quickly), but t=
hey're best
Told in person.
But just as an example of my family's comfortableness with the subject, I wa=
s talking
With Baz on the phone a couple of hours ago, he's in the mountain with my gr=
andparents,
My dad and some of my cousins and he was telling me he was sick, and I asked=
 how so
And he just started matter of factly describing the color, shape, consistenc=
y and even smell=20
of his bowel movements. I guess it's a little gross, but damn, does that kid=
 make me laugh.

So, things I dislike about my country:
Some of its people's snotty attitude, the racism, the teaching system, the w=
ay people
Think France is by far superior to every other country, some of the politici=
ans.

And the things I like about it:
Some landscapes, the rudeness (strangely I found myself missing it while I w=
as in England),
The healthcare, the train system, some of the food, the richness of its hist=
ory, its proximity=20
To all the countries surrounding it, the strikes.

I somewhat care about fashion, in the way I have to think about what I'm wea=
ring when
I go out and can't just throw on the first thing I find (unless it looks goo=
d). I don't really
Have a defined style though, I just wear things I think are pretty and don't=
 really think
About what style it is.
I don't know if French people really dress differently than in the US, I gue=
ss it depends
On where in France and where in the US you are comparing.

I like people who are kind, smart (not necessarily school smart, I just enjo=
y interesting=20
Conversations), who have the same sense of humor as me (a little sarcastic, c=
hildish,
Dark, or goofy, it depends on my mood). I like people who don't take themsel=
ves too
Seriously. I have a thing for musicians, but don't exclude those who don't p=
lay music.
I like finding people who are passionate about the same movies, books or mus=
icians
As me. I generally think it's really cute when someone is passionate about s=
omething,
A sport, a hobby..., as long as it's something I like. I like people who hav=
e opinions and
Stand by them. I like people who are respectful (of the environment, of wome=
n mostly).
I'm attracted by nice smiles, intelligent eyes, nice hands, broad shoulders,=
 and,
I might as well admit it, cute butts (who isn't?). I also like the kind of t=
all, skinny, sometimes
Nerdy, cute-but-he-doesn't- know-it type of boy.
But I find physical traits are less important than the person's personality i=
f I'm looking for something long term.

No I do not care about watching or playing sport either. I do like sports ca=
rs though=20
(My dad's influence I think) but I don't know much about them.

No I do not see myself staying in N=C3=AEmes, at least not for my studies (t=
he university is a=20
bit of a joke) I prefer imagining myself in a bigger city. I don't know wher=
e I'd like to=20
Move, maybe somewhere in France, maybe in another country... I think I'll ju=
st have
To go where the wind takes me when the time comes.

I guess I'll ask you the same questions, plus since it's a little on the top=
ic, what are the=20
Clich=C3=A9s or impressions you have on France?

Love,
Soph
