I especially was struck by this part:

"One explanation for the inflammation results could lie with the Cry
3Bb1 and Cry 1Ab proteins that these GM corn varieties are engineered to
produce. They act as insecticides by inducing pore formation and
disintegration of the gut tissue (Spok et al., 2007) of certain grubs
that attack corn plants. It has been argued that these proteins cannot
harm the gastrointestinal tract of mammals because mammals lack the
necessary gut environment and receptors (ANZFA, 2000). However,
Vazquez-Padron et al. (2000) found six proteins in the mouse small
intestine that could bind to a Cry protein (Cry 1Ac). Furthermore, when
the Cry protein bound to these proteins, it resulted in
hyperpolarisation of the intestine, which is consistent with the
formation of cationic channels, as occurs in the insect gut
(Vazquez-Padron et al., 2000)." - from p. 51, "A long-term toxicology
study on pigs fed a combined genetically modified (GM) soy and GM maize
diet", by Judy A. Carman, Howard R. Vlieger, Larry J. Ver Steeg, Verlyn
E. Sneller, Garth W. Robinson, Catherine A. Clinch-Jones, Julie I.
Haynes, & John W. Edwards,  Journal of Organic Systems, vol. 8, No. 1, 2013

I think this might help explain the preponderance of "fat" people who
are mostly hard round bellies...

Also, forgive the ridiculous quote, but it is so awesome to finally find
a study that isn't riddled with statistical holes.
