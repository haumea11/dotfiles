Wow, that sounds great.  I'm not that good with computers, so I'm always
impressed with people who are.
I've been on vacation for over a month now, and I also spend a lot of (too
much?) time sleeping.  But it's so hot here there's not much else to do. It
gets to more than 30=C2=B0C which is about 90=C2=B0F I think.  You truly ca=
n't do
much.
Life has been good.  I moved to Strasbourg last August, for college. It's a
really beautiful city.  It's like 15 minutes away from Germany.  If you
come to France, you can come crash on my couch.  I'm back in N=C3=AEmes for=
 the
summer, it's pretty strange being back here.
You're a senior next year, right?  Are you thinking of colleges yet?
Love,
Louise
