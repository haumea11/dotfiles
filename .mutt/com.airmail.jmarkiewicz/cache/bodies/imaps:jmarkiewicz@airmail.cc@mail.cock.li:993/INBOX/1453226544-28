Hello Solo and Ensemble-ers,

I have been working with Stephanie Miller who will be playing piano for you
to set up rehearsal times.
Since you will all most likely be staying for musical practice anyways, we
will rehearse next Wednesday (Feb. 3rd) after school in my room. I will
make sure that Liz knows where you are so that you can run through.
We will then rehearse the following week since its the week before
competition, again on a Wednesday (Feb 10th).

I encourage you to bring a recording device even if it's just your computer
or laptop to record her playing your accompaniment so that you have
something to practice with at home.

Ladies, I have copies of your songs to give her. Gentlemen, I have not
received photocopies of your music so that she can begin to practice.
Please give that to me ASAP so that she does not have to rush to learn the
music.
Also, please be reminded that she is charging a very reasonable fee of
$35.00 total for these two rehearsals and the performance.

Thanks,
*Christen Joyce*

*Choral Director*

*Bishop Watterson High School*
