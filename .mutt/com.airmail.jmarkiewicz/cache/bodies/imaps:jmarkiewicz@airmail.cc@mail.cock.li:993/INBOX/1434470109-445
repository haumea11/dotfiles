Hello Choir Families,
It is almost December and with the new month comes an extremely busy time
for the choir program! Here's whats coming up in the next few weeks:

1. Monday, December 7th - Grade School Music Tour. Students will be
traveling to St. Michael, OLP, St. Brigid, and St. Brendan during the
school day to perform. The travel permissions and emergency medical slips
you turned in at the beginning of the school year serve as permission. If
you would prefer your student to not miss this day of school, please let me
know so arrangements can be made. Students will be taking school buses to
all locations and will be eating lunch on their own at the Olentangy Plaza.
Students will need to bring money to purchase lunch.

2. Wednesday, December 9th - After School Concert Rehearsal 3:30-5pm in the
Old Gym. This is a mandatory rehearsal for all students.

3. Thursday, December 10th - 6:15pm Call, 7:00pm Concert in Old Gym.
Students are to meet in the Choir Room at 6:15 in uniform to warm-up before
the concert.


4. Raising Cane's Spirit Night - Wednesday Dec. 9th. After rehearsal, swing
by the Olentangy River Rd. location between 5-9pm for dinner. Hand them the
Flyer and the choir will receive 20% of your total purchase.

5. After the Concert, a Cookie and Punch Reception is held in the
cafeteria. Please bring the following items and place in the cafeteria
before coming to the Choir Room on December 10th:
Freshman - Napkins, Plates, Cups
Sophomores - Cookies
Juniors - Beverage
Seniors - Your pick of any of the above

6. Thanks for picking up your Poinsettias. There were some really beautiful
flowers this year!

7. Friday, Dec. 18th State Auto Nativity Performance 7pm - I will send out
more information closer to the date. Students will not need to be in
uniform, but should dress warmly as they are performing outside. This is
not a mandatory performance, but encouraged. It will not last longer than
30-40 minutes.

I am sure I've forgotten something I should've included. Please let me know
if you have any questions and you'll probably receive another email from me
next week.
