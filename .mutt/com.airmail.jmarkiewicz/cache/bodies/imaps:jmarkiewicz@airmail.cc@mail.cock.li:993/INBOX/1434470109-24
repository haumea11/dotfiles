Hey John,

Oh yeah, it would be totally awesome if you came to France!
The invitation always stands of course, so if you ever want to visit,
Maybe give us a call in advance, but we would really enjoy having you here!

Ok thanks, I'll check the games out!

No, actually, I don't really know much about our computer science programs,
I can to look into it though if you'd like.=20
Although I do think there are some schools that might have good programs
Like polytech Grenoble or Montpellier, but I don't know if that's really wha=
t
You're looking for so you'd have to look into it and see for yourself.

Okay so I've thought about a few conversation topics, and here are some=20
Questions to which I don't think I know the answer, you don't have to respon=
d
To all of them if you find them bothersome. Here we go:
Have you ever traveled abroad? Do you like traveling?
Do you have a girlfriend? Or a boyfriend, I don't know?
Do you have a best friend?
We could also talk about more basic stuff, like what's your favorite color, o=
r your
Favorite food?=20
I know of your career projects, but do you have any family projects? Do you
Think one day you'll maybe have kids? (That I could be an aunt to and spoil?=
)
Where would you like to live later, in which country, city or setting?
Do you have a favorite subject in school?
Is there someone who inspires you? A musician, scientist, politician, or oth=
er?

I realize some of these questions kind of suck, so if you have any ideas, do=
 tell!

Best wishes,
Soph.
