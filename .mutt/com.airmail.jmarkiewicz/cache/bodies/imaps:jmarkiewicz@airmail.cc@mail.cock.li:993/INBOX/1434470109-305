Hello,
If you copied down the dates from my syllabus at the beginning of the year,
you know that next week is a busy performance week for us. Students seemed
very surprised when I mentioned these dates yesterday, so I wanted to send
out an email to make sure everyone was brought up to date.

Wednesday, Oct. 28th - 6:30-8pm - Requiem Rehearsal @ OLP Sanctuary
Saturday, Oct. 31st - 5:30-7pm -  Eagle Auction - Choir Room
Sunday, Nov. 1st - 4:00 Call, 4:30 Performance - Faure's Requiem

If students haven't shared with you, we have been working very hard at
learning Faure's *Requiem* Mass to perform with the Our Lady of Peace
Parish Choir for All Soul's Day. This is a 45 minute, 7 movement work. The
Concert Choir is singing 4 of the movements and the OLP Choir will be
singing the other 3. The organist from St. Joesph's Cathedral will be
accompanying the choirs. It is a beautiful piece of music and a wonderful
reflection time for All Souls and All Saint's Day.
The performance is being held in the OLP Sanctuary beginning at 4:30pm and
admission is free. Please consider attending.

Thanks,
*Christen Joyce*

*Choral Director*

*Bishop Watterson High School*
