Hello Choir Families!
Tonight is our performance at the State Auto Nativity.
I'll take one last count of students today in class to make sure that we
have a decent group going. If I cancel, I will send out another email, a
Remind text, and post on Twitter. If you don't hear anything from me after
this email, then we are on for tonight!

Here are the Details:
*Where:* State Auto Insurance Building downtown - 518 East Broad St.
Columbus,OH 43215

*When:* Meet at 6:45pm at the Main (north) Entrance of the building. I will
be getting there at 6:30pm to meet with our host. Please arrive on time. If
you are late, you will have to find us at the performance tent.

*Wear:* Dress SUPER warm! Go figure that it actually turned into December
weather when we are performing outside. There is no need to dress up.
Tennis shoes are totally appropriate. Big coats, hats, scarves, gloves!

*How Long*: We perform from 7:00-7:30pm. You will be free to leave and
explore the nativity at 7:45 at the latest.

*Where Do I Park:* Visitors Lot is available to the north of the building.
The lot is accessible from Washington Street (runs between the State Auto
building and Columbus Museum of Art). Please note that Washington Street is
one-way only going north of Broad St.

See you tonight at 6:45!
*Christen Joyce*

*Choral Director*

*Bishop Watterson High School*
