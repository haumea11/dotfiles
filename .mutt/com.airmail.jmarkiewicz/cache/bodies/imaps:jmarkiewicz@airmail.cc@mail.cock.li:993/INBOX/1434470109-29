Hey John,

I really love traveling, and have been to a few foreign countries,
Either with my family or on school trips. I've visited the United States
(Obviously), Spain on several occasions (going to Barcelona is literally
A three hour drive, and one of my uncles has a house in the south of
The country), Ireland, and Germany twice with school. I'm also going
To London next week with my best friend whose name is Emma and=20
Who has been my partner in crime for about 13 years. We're going there=20
Alone, so I think it'll be quite fun.

I am currently in a relationship with a girl, though you are the only family=

Member to know this, so I'm counting on your discretion. Today is actually o=
ur
Fourth month anniversary, but to be honest I don't know if it's going to las=
t
Much longer, which is sad. I've also been with boys, but this is the first
Real relationship I've ever had.

I think my favorite color at the moment red, And my favorite food is Thai=20=

noodles, but it is extremely hard to find decent ones in France.

I don't really have any family projects, I did try to convince my family
To move to New Zealand, but they weren't very enthusiastic,
So I guess I'll just have to maybe do it on my own one day.
The thought of having kids (in a few years) was rather appealing to me
Until Louise, who, as you must know it, studies biology, told me in a very
Detailed manner about childbirth and breastfeeding and other shit,
So now I'm contemplating adoption, or just not having kids. But it's not
Something I really worry about, since if it must happen, it will happen in a=
t=20
Least ten years.

Having always lived in a city, even though I enjoy the country side,=20
I believe I would have a very hard time trying to live anywhere but in
A city.

My favorite subject depends as much on the teacher as on the subject itself,=

So this year I think my favorite subjects were math and physics.

There are some philosophers who inspire me, like Jean Jacques Rousseau
Who wrote texts against slavery, but also women's rights activists.
=20
I think my favorite album is either The head on the door (by the Cure) or=20=

Pink Floyd's Dark side of the moon. I don't really have a favorite band, jus=
t
Many bands that I enjoy, like Phoenix, Daft Punk, Metronomy, the Red Hot
Chili Peppers, Belle and Sebastian (hippie music, my mom would say),=20
and others. My favorite song changes all the time, but at the moment it's
Get down on it by Earth Wind and Fire (you are authorized to make fun
Of me).

My favorite candy is peanuts m&m's, my favorite drink is Schweppes.
I love rainstorms, my favorite book is the Spellman Files by Lisa Lutz,
I don't have a favorite movie and my favorite TV show is 30 rock
Or Orange is the new black.

Yes I own a computer, it's a piece of shit dell laptop (sorry I can't tell y=
ou
More about it) that is given to every sophomore in my region as part of a=20=

Program that is supposed to enable people who don't own a computer
To be able to work on one (but everyone just ends up watching movies=20
With theirs). We also have one "house computer" and an Asus laptop.

I can get rather excited about music, and I don't have many musician
Friends, so they always look at me like I'm the biggest nerd when I start
Talking about this rhythm that I learned or when I try telling them somethin=
g
I found funny during a music class but that they don't understand.

I guess my biggest short time goal is getting good grades at the bac
And finding and getting accepted at a good university. It's not very excitin=
g,
But that's it.

I've never written any fiction, I have thought about it a couple of times,
But have always lacked inspiration.
I've never composed any music either, but it would be so much fun if=20
I ever got to it!

I haven't got any ideas for new questions, but I'd like to know the answers
You would give to the ones you asked me!

Love,
Soph.
