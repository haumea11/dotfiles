Vijay Nair, Oct 1-3 2015

Posted 7 days ago

The Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan cordially
invites you to join us for a special conference in Ann Arbor in honor of
Vijay Nair's birthday to celebrate his many contributions to the
profession in general and the Statistics Department at the University of
Michigan in particular.   The conference will run from the evening of
Thursday Oct 1 2015, opening with a reception and poster session,
through the afternoon of Saturday Oct 3, with a banquet on Friday night
and single-track sessions on Friday and Saturday. The theme of the
conference is the changing role of statistics in the world;  it will
feature some talks on industrial statistics, to which Vijay has made
many contributions over the course of his career, as well as many
general talks with the broad theme of statistics in the age of data
science and big data, an area which Vijay was instrumental in building
up at Michigan. More information about the conference can be found at
the conference website http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/vn65/, including the
list of invited speakers.

We have travel funds available to cover registration and travel expenses
for junior researchers (graduate students and those within 5 years from
PhD) who participate in the poster session on Thursday. We would
especially encourage such junior researchers to submit posters. Space is
limited, so please submit your title and abstract and register as soon
as possible.

Please don't hesitate to email us at vnn2015committee@umich.edu if you
have any questions.

With warm regards,

Liza Levina, Long Nguyen, Kerby Shedden, Ji Zhu (the organizing committee)
