Hello!

You are signed up to attend classes at Ohio LinuxFest Institute.
Classes start at 9 AM on Friday.

Registration should be open by 8 AM, so you should have plenty of time
to check in and get situated.

You will need to bring a laptop with you.  Some classes may have
additional requirements.  I'm working to get those requirements
identified on a per-class basis, so you may get additional emails from
me.


By default, Ohio LinuxFest **does not** share your email address with
your instructors.  If you consent to me sharing your email address
with your instructors, please reply to this email to affirm that. Then
your instructors can coordinate directly with you.


If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

Thank you very much for participating in Ohio LinuxFest Institute.
We're really looking forward to this weekend!

Cheers,
Scott
