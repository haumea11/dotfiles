Dear John,

It must be getting a little redundant, but I'm sorry for not responding
sooner,
I wrote quite a few drafts (in French and in English) but each time I tried
to
pick one up back again, I couldn't figure out what I had been trying to say
and just started all over again. So anyway, I finally got my shit together
and finished writing an e-mail.

Hey, that was some pretty good French! I'll put a quick correction at the
end
of this e-mail if you want to have a look at it, I also find that
expressing
myself in a foreign language is way more complicated than understanding it.

I ave not yet succumbed to subscribing to Snapchat or Instagram like most
of my friends, but if I ever do, I'll be sure to communicate my usernames
to
you.

Here is how I would describe myself: I would say that on one hand, my
qualities are creativity, humour (or so I like to think), intelligence, a
capacity
to adapt to new situations, and, most of the time, niceness. On the other
hand, I would say I am a little childish, perhaps a little heavy at times
,very
easily stressed out, I have an amazing capacity to be late, and I am
pathologically shy (which can be tiresome for me and for the people around
me).

To me, a true friend is a person I can laugh with, but also a person I can
have a serious conversation with, a person who has my back and won't let
me down the first chance they get, someone who won't judge me and to
whom I can say anything. Of course, I too find it important to enjoy this
person's company and to have similar interests.

School started on September third, and to be honest, it could be going
better. I'm constantly buried under work and can't seem to be able to sort
my personal life. Plus all the teachers are putting pressure on us to
succeed
and it's not helping. So I'm a little down at the moment and often find
myself
questioning my mental faculties and/or my chances at academic success.
I know that's a little silly because I've always been a good student, but
some
of my grades have been, well, bad (but some of them have also been quite
good though, so at least that's comforting).

Lately I've rediscovered Moby's album "Play" and really like this one song
called "Run on". I also listen a lot to Belle and Sebastian, my favorite
song
by them is "If she wants me". I also like listening to Simon and
Garfunkel's
"Sound of Silence" and this french song by a guy named Benabar called
"Le d=C3=AEner, it's quite funny, listening to it might have you work a lit=
tle
on your
french pronunciation and accent (if you want to).

I honestly do not know what my most prized physical possession is... I have
some objects (clothes, instruments, pictures, phone etc.) that I enjoy a
lot
and would be sad to lose, but nothing that really stands out.

My favorite time of day is the late afternoon and the early evening,
especially during the Summer, because it's the time I can go sit outside
with
people and talk and eat while listening to the sound of the nature
surrounding
me, and during the winter because it's the time I go back home, put on some
nice warm fluffy pyjamas and drink hot chocolate.

Aha, now this is a tricky question... I think I'd have to say blue pen,
even
though I sometimes enjoy a good old black pen.

Per usual, could you also answer your own questions and a few others
(you're right, there is a pattern!)

What is your typical day like? (at what time do you wake up, eat, leave
for school, what do you do when you come back home, etc.)

What is your favorite season? (and why?)

Do you have a celebrity crush (or celebrity crushes)?

Love,
Sophie.


Ch=C3=A8re Sophie,

Comme je l'ai d=C3=A9cid=C3=A9, je t'=C3=A9cris une partie de cet e-mail en=

creativity, humour (or so I like to think), intelligence, a capacity</div><=
div>to adapt to new situations, and, most of the time, niceness. On the oth=

Peut-=C3=AAtre je peux =C3=A9crire davantage en fran=C3=A7ais la prochaine =

<br>
Whoo.=C2=A0 That was tricky, but I don&#39;t know enough French to write an=
ything<br>
worth writing without aid of Google Translate.=C2=A0 I feel like I&#39;m ce=
rtainly<br>
understanding what you&#39;re writing in French, but actual composition is<=
br>
dramatically trickier.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s interesting to hear someone call English simple, but I suppose the=
re<br>
are aspects of French that are comparitively confusing and some nice points=
<br>
of English.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve never really had to think about the language, it=
 just<br>
sort of works, so I&#39;m not a great judge.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s see, my writing style.=C2=A0 I suppose I&#39;ve already touched o=
n that I<br>
think I write things a bit on the &quot;wordy&quot; side, and my sentence s=
tructure<br>
takes a little getting used to.=C2=A0 I would describe the way I write Engl=
ish<br>
as &quot;interestingly, but well&quot; and the way I write other languages =
as<br>
&quot;practically not at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Guilty pleasures, since I already have yours and I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#3=
9;t<br>
judge me... I&#39;m a little embarrassed to still enjoy quite a lot of dubs=
tep<br>
(not Skrillex or anything, but still dubstep.)=C2=A0 I&#39;ll rationalize i=
t to you<br>
by saying how it&#39;s no longer anywhere near my favorite sort of electron=
ic<br>
music, but it&#39;s the sort of music that works very well for gaming.=C2=
=A0 You<br>
don&#39;t have to pay attention to it and it&#39;s high energy.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m sure I have some better guilty pleasure than that, but off-hand I c=
an&#39;t<br>
think of any.=C2=A0 As an aside, I think the name for guilty pleasures in F=
rench<br>
has a much cooler meaning than &quot;guilty pleasures.&quot;<br>
<br>
As far as little things that make me happy every time they happen, I really=
<br>
like having a good cup of coffee after sleeping in on a weekend.=C2=A0 I&#3=
9;m happy<br>
every time I sit down in front of my computer, because it&#39;s just so<br>
pleasant to use.=C2=A0 The feeling of being engrossed in a book, or an albu=
m, or<br>
a movie is also a wonderful one.=C2=A0 I guess also, I like the feeling whe=
n<br>
you&#39;re around a bunch of your friends and everyone&#39;s having a good =
time and<br>
you feel like you belong.=C2=A0 New bed sheets.=C2=A0 Fall and Winter eveni=
ngs,<br>
especially Winter once it gets cold.=C2=A0 Discovering a new band or a new<=
br>
album.=C2=A0 When the package you&#39;ve been waiting for in the mail arriv=
es.<br>
Those sorts of things make me happy.<br>
<br>
Aside from facebook (which I don&#39;t really like having to keep) and e-ma=
il<br>
(which I gladly maintain several of) I also spend a lot of time on YouTube<=
br>
(so much amazing content, it&#39;s how I stay away from TV shows as much as=
 I<br>
do) and Tumblr (not for a lot of the content it&#39;s known for.)=C2=A0 Red=
dit,<br>
Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram are also places I can be found (and if you=
<br>
have a snapchat or are willing to share your instagram feel free to pass me=
<br>
the username.)=C2=A0 Imgur is also a place where sometimes there&#39;s qual=
ity<br>
content, but it&#39;s not a very focused site.<br>
<br>
Fears.=C2=A0 I guess I find heights a little unsettling, and the idea of<br=
>
something I can&#39;t see coming at me terrifying.=C2=A0 Noises that get lo=
uder as<br>
they approach sometimes make me uneasy, but never to the point of real<br>
phobia or anything.=C2=A0 I guess I&#39;m afraid of living a life I&#39;m b=
ored with,<br>
and would really hate most of all to be a boring or unsuccessful person.=C2=
=A0 I<br>
couldn&#39;t stand that.<br>
<br>
Asking me to describe myself will get an interesting answer, though I&#39;m=
 not<br>
sure if it&#39;ll be a really accurate one.=C2=A0 I would state my good qua=
lities as<br>
humor, intelligence, confidence, an ability to pick things up quickly, and<=
br>
I would class myself as personable.=C2=A0 On the downsides, I tend to be a =
bit<br>
intense for some people&#39;s tastes, I have a tendency toward self-deproca=
tion<br>
and even depression, and I tend to be a very polarizing individual (that<br=
>
is, people love me or they hate me.)=C2=A0 This is of course a compression,=
<br>
there are obviously other things in both categories but I don&#39;t want to=
 go<br>
on for three and a half pages about my personality.<br>
<br>
As far as what I look for in a friend, ideally I can find someone who<br>
considers me their friend, who I can have a good conversation and laugh<br>
with, who shares a few of my interests so we have some things to do or talk=
<br>
about, someone who&#39;s not too terribly racist or sexist, and generally j=
ust<br>
someone I find fun to be around.=C2=A0 I can&#39;t stand people who claim t=
o be your<br>
friend but hate you, or people who&#39;re racist, sexist, or bigoted, and I=
<br>
tend to really be unable to deal with people whom I find annoying.=C2=A0 Ma=
inly<br>
I just look for someone who enjoys my company and whose company I enjoy,<br=
>
and go from there, I guess.<br>
<br>
So, as usual, I&#39;d like you to answer your questions and a few others (s=
ee<br>
a pattern developing?)<br>
<br>
If school has started back up for you, how is school?=C2=A0 If it hasn&#39;=
t, how is<br>
it being the person I&#39;m jealous of?<br>
<br>
Any albums enter into your listening lately?=C2=A0 Any music recommendation=
s?<br>
<br>
What&#39;s your most prized physical possession?<br>
<br>
Blue or black ink pen, or another color?=C2=A0 (I have to put SOME silly<br=
>
questions in here.)<br>
<br>
Favorite time of day (or night?)<br>
<br>
P.S. Here&#39;s the shitty translation I did of part of your e-mail.=C2=A0 =
I didn&#39;t<br>

br>
rather than later.=C2=A0 Feel free to call me out on mistakes I made, becau=
se<br>
that will leave me better at the language.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
This is an attempt at translation.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t go for exact translati=
on, I<br>
tend to aim more for a reading that stays true to the intent of a passage.<=
br>
As far as French goes, I think that may make this a disaster.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind I&#39;ve taken a year of French and I think the teacher did a<=
br>
terrible job, but I also am sitting with google translate open on the<br>
second monitor.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t use it for more than a couple words at a =
time, and<br>
it&#39;s how I deal with my lack of proper vocab.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll make a couple errors, feel free to point them out if =
you<br>
catch them.<br>

Dear John,<br>
<br>
Since you asked, I&#39;ll write this e-mail to you in French.<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t worry about the length of your e-mails, it doesn&#39;t bother me =
at all;<br>
on the contrary, it&#39;s good.=C2=A0 Don&#39;t apologize for having so man=
y questions<br>
about language (and no, the French education system being what it is, I<br>
am sorry to say I don&#39;t speak my third language, German, very well.)<br=
>
Besides that, I would like to apologise if I take longer than expected to<b=
r>
reply to my e-mails.<br>
<br>
No, nothing really exceptional happened on my trip to Corsica, it was just<=
br>
going to the river, to the sea, or staying at a house.<br>
<br>
My dream car?=C2=A0 I think, though I could never afford it, it would be a<=
br>
Bentley Continental GT or a Corvette Z06 (red preferable, like from the<br>
Prince song.)<br>
<br>
The stereotypes about Americans are all sort of the same:=C2=A0 they always=
 eat<br>
fast food, they&#39;re all a bunch of racsts, they live in big houses and h=
ave<br>
big fridges, big televisions, and huge cars.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t like stereot=
ypes, but<br>
I find it interesting to know what people think about people from other<br>
countries.<br>
<br>
I listened to the album Simple Things by Zero 7 and &quot;Trains&quot; by P=
orcupine<br>
Tree, and I liked them a lot, and I&#39;m starting to wonder if you&#39;ll =
ever<br>
recommend me music I _don&#39;t_ like.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I love traditional games!=C2=A0 I&#39;ve never tried Mafia [it&#39;s =
basically the<br>
same as Werewolf] but I often play Werewolf with my friends or my family.<b=
r>
I also babysit sometimes and the kids I watch always show me [&quot;make me=
<br>
discover&quot; doesn&#39;t sit well in English, obviously] a new game, whic=
h I<br>
really like.=C2=A0 Otherwise I like a bit more classics like Monopoly or Tr=
ivial<br>
Pursuit, Uno and belote (it&#39;s a card game, I showed it to you the last =
time<br>
we went camping, no?)=C2=A0 [you did, and it was a fantastic time.]=C2=A0 I=
 also would<br>
like to learn to play poker. [from what I know, a fun game.]<br>
<br>
I like English pretty well, notably because it&#39;s a language I find simp=
le,<br>
where with French, there are all kinds of stories [kinds of stories?=C2=A0 =
My<br>
translation has failed me, or maybe it&#39;s an idiom of sorts] about<br>
agreement, exceptions, tenses, conjugations, polite forms, etc. which make<=
br>
the language very hard to learn.=C2=A0 Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t find yo=
ur writing<br>
annoying.<br>
<br>
I would say my writing style is fairly simple both in French and in<br>
English.=C2=A0 Here I&#39;m trying to write with as exact grammar as possib=
le, a bit<br>
like on my tests, to make it easier to translate [no real problems so far,<=
br>
though I imagine I&#39;d start to struggle if the idioms started getting th=
rown<br>
at me] and to not influence you so you talk like a trucker.=C2=A0 [I&#39;m =
going to<br>
assume talking like a French trucker is kind of like talking like an Americ=
an<br>
trucker, which is not something I&#39;m going for with my foreign language<=
br>
knowledge.]=C2=A0 Besides, the way I talk with my friends is a little less<=
br>
formally, like I think people do in all countries [very true.]<br>
<br>
Yes, I do have guilty pleasures (&quot;p=C3=A9ch=C3=A9s mignons&quot;)! [I =
far prefer the term<br>
&quot;cute sins&quot; to &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; but maybe that&#39;s =
just me]=C2=A0 It&#39;s very<br>
embarrassing, but since you did say you wouldn&#39;t judge me, I&#39;m goin=
g to say<br>
them nevertheless.=C2=A0 I like to watch shitty series like Vampire Diaries=
,<br>
Pretty Little Liars, Teen Wolf or even Gossip Girl. [translation ends<br>
here.]<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
P.P.S. Feel free to respond in either French or English, though I think a<b=
r>
response in French would give me an excuse to keep reading material in<br>
French.=C2=A0 I suppose I&#39;d ask you not write it in German if you&#39;r=
e not<br>
confident in your German skills, though.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Hey Sophie,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Good to hear you enjoyed your time in Corsica.=C2=A0 Anything sta=
nd out about<br>
&gt; &gt; the trip?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; No bacon is a little sad, though I don&#39;t really think it woul=
d be the worst<br>
&gt; &gt; thing that could happen.=C2=A0 It would probably be good for me i=
f bacon weren&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; available.=C2=A0 Most of the United States would be sent into a p=
anic.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s interesting the difference between France and the US on =
alcohol.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt; &gt; could get my hands on some (I know people, though I don&#39;t rea=
lly use the<br>
&gt; &gt; connections I have) and I&#39;ve been offered my fair share of th=
e stuff, but<br>
&gt; &gt; if I walked into a store and asked to buy a bottle of everclear o=
r<br>
&gt; &gt; something I would be carded and sent away immediately.=C2=A0 I st=
ill have a<br>
&gt; &gt; little bit of a young-looking face for my age, so I think I&#39;l=
l be carded<br>
&gt; &gt; well past 21.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I think it makes for different attitudes and drinking habits in p=
eople<br>
&gt; &gt; around our age, honestly.=C2=A0 American teens are pretty reckles=
s, and the fact<br>
&gt; &gt; that drinking is illegal and most parents frown upon it intensely=
 prompts<br>
&gt; &gt; the drunk teenagers to attempt to drive home.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This ruins driving for responsible people , who have curfews beca=
use teens<br>
&gt; &gt; are such bad drivers at night.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As far as my opinions on alcohol go, I agree with you for the mos=
t part.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t really think I have many good opportunities to drink, t=
o be honest.<br>
&gt; &gt; The effects it has on inhibition make me hesitant to drink anythi=
ng at all<br>
&gt; &gt; unless I&#39;m around people I really trust, and there&#39;s no w=
ay in hell I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; driving drunk, which leaves very few options.=C2=A0 There&#39;s a=
lso a tendency<br>
&gt; &gt; toward alcoholism in both sides of my family, and I can kind of u=
nderstand<br>
&gt; &gt; why.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I think in the right circumstances, and with moderation, though, =
it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; pretty nice.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve found even with the motor control dro=
p I can still type<br>
&gt; &gt; pretty well, which I&#39;m pleased with.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Your family really is comfortable with bathroom discussion.=C2=A0=
 My family<br>
&gt; &gt; tends to joke, but we don&#39;t have a whole lot of direct discus=
sion on the<br>

&gt; &gt; to cultivate.=C2=A0 I&#39;m not picky about brands, but I tend to=
 like button-up<br>
&gt; &gt; shirts, navy blue, and white.=C2=A0 My trick to not having troubl=
e picking<br>
&gt; &gt; outfits is I have a simple set of colors that most of my wardrobe=
 consists<br>
&gt; &gt; of, so almost everything I own can be worn together.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As far as what I like in people, they have to be pleasant and fun=
ny, and I<br>
&gt; &gt; really prefer someone fairly laidback.=C2=A0 If I don&#39;t share=
 interests with<br>
&gt; &gt; someone, at least a couple, it&#39;s going to be hard for me to d=
ate them.<br>
&gt; &gt; Passion is nice, as is the ability to debate things without consi=
dering it<br>
&gt; &gt; a personal confrontation (I like to argue points and play devil&#=
39;s advocate<br>
&gt; &gt; from time to time.)=C2=A0 I agree, a nice butt is always a plus.<=
br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t really consider attractiveness to be as important as =
personality,<br>
&gt; &gt; either.=C2=A0 In girls, I&#39;m a bit of a leg man but I really d=
on&#39;t have one<br>
&gt; &gt; specific type.=C2=A0 I&#39;m not really a fan of the blonde tan m=
ade up look, but<br>
&gt; &gt; there&#39;s certainly nothing wrong with girls who pursue it or p=
eople who like<br>
&gt; &gt; it.=C2=A0 In men, I like them on the thinner side but not rail-th=
in.=C2=A0 Regardless<br>
&gt; &gt; of gender, though, I&#39;m really into personality.=C2=A0 I&#39;m=
 definitely more<br>
&gt; &gt; sexually interested in girls, but I would still say I&#39;m not t=
ied to any one<br>
&gt; &gt; gender for attraction at all.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Oh, also, if I can&#39;t have a good conversation with someone th=
ere&#39;s no way<br>

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Sports cars are nice, but I have to say I probably know even less=
 about<br>
&gt; &gt; them than you do.=C2=A0 As far as cars go, I guess one day I&#39;=
d like to drive<br>
&gt; &gt; manual transmission.<br>

&gt; &gt; Do you have a dream car?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t see myself staying in Columbus after I go to college,=
 just because<br>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if I want to stay in the United States and I def=
initely want<br>
&gt; &gt; to live in a larger city.=C2=A0 I have a thing for big cities, an=
d I sort of<br>
&gt; &gt; want to at least visit NYC at some point.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Stereotypes, clich=C3=A9s, or impressions about France, huh?=C2=
=A0 Well, there are<br>
&gt; &gt; the typical ones like that everyone drinks wine and eats baguette=
s and<br>
&gt; &gt; croissants and good cheeses and that people wear horizontally str=
iped<br>
&gt; &gt; shirts and berets (at this point I&#39;m just listing attributes =
of how an<br>
&gt; &gt; American would try to draw &quot;French Person&quot; in a game of=
 pictionary or<br>
&gt; &gt; something.)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; We also think you all are more cultured and more snooty about it =
than we<br>
&gt; &gt; are.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s definitely a conception that Paris is incredibly fash=
ionable, and<br>
&gt; &gt; that French people are smelly.=C2=A0 The former actually leads to=
 an<br>
&gt; &gt; interesting form of culture shock in some people:<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0<a href=3D"https://fr.wikipedia.=
org/wiki/Syndrome_de_Paris" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://fr=
.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome_de_Paris</a><br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Also, there&#39;s the idea in America that French women don&#39;t=
 shave their<br>
&gt; &gt; armpits, as compared to American women who generally are expected=
 to.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t get the big deal with the idea women should be clean sh=
aven, I figure<br>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s their business and not mine.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t much care=
 regardless.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As far as what I think France has, I would estimate overall you g=
uys are a<br>
&gt; &gt; little less conservative than us (people in the states get angry =
any time<br>
&gt; &gt; anyone goes on strike, it seems like.)=C2=A0 There&#39;s probably=
 a bit less<br>
&gt; &gt; corporate influence in your politics, and you also probably do dr=
ink a bit<br>
&gt; &gt; more wine than we do, but just like anywhere French people are ju=
st people.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Well, what about Americans?=C2=A0 I know you&#39;ve been here, so=
 you have a bit<br>
&gt; &gt; more of a read on us, but I&#39;m sure there are some stereotypes=
 and ideas you<br>
&gt; &gt; guys have of us.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Also, if you haven&#39;t heard of them, there&#39;s a _fantastic_=
 band I failed to<br>
&gt; &gt; mention earlier, Zero 7.=C2=A0 Their album &quot;Simple Things&qu=
ot; is amazing, really<br>
&gt; &gt; most of their albums are good.=C2=A0 I&#39;d recommend starting w=
ith &quot;Simple<br>
&gt; &gt; Things,&quot; though.=C2=A0 It&#39;s one of their more laidback w=
orks, which I really<br>
&gt; &gt; like.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; On the subject of music recommendations, another song that&#39;s =
really<br>
&gt; &gt; important to me is &quot;Trains&quot; by Porcupine Tree.=C2=A0 It=
&#39;s among the songs I<br>
&gt; &gt; always seem to end up playing when I play guitar.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Do you fancy any traditional games?=C2=A0 I&#39;ve recently falle=
n into a group of<br>
&gt; &gt; people who play Werewolf (it&#39;s a lot like Mafia, if you&#39;v=
e ever played<br>
&gt; &gt; either) and it&#39;s a lot of fun.=C2=A0 Sometimes, games played =
with cards or pen<br>
&gt; &gt; and paper or board games are better than most video games.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As someone who&#39;s pretty fluent in both languages (at least I =
would hope<br>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;re also fluent in French) what are your opinions on Engli=
sh?=C2=A0 I&#39;m not<br>
&gt; &gt; the hugest fan of it, but the lack of exactness in the way Englis=
h is<br>
&gt; &gt; spoken and written lets me get away with a lot.=C2=A0 I kind of p=
lay with the<br>
&gt; &gt; language as I speak or write.=C2=A0 I hope my correspondence isn&=
#39;t too terribly<br>
&gt; &gt; obnoxious, since I tend to write some pretty intense sentences.<b=
r>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; How would you describe your writing style, and does it change dra=
matically<br>
&gt; &gt; between the languages?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Also, I recently heard the song you had mentioned being terrible =
a while<br>
&gt; &gt; back, &quot;Bad Blood.&quot;=C2=A0 I think terrible is a gentle d=
escription for the sort<br>
&gt; &gt; of bad that song is.=C2=A0 On that front, I have a bit of distast=
e for &quot;Worth<br>
&gt; &gt; It.&quot;=C2=A0 Really, most stuff that gets radio play on top 50=
 stations, I have<br>
&gt; &gt; trouble liking.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I ought to get good enough at writing French that I can correspon=
d in your<br>
&gt; &gt; home language.=C2=A0 It could be cool if you responded to this in=
 French instead<br>
&gt; &gt; of English, since with e-mail I have time to sit down and transla=
te out<br>
&gt; &gt; anything I can&#39;t work from what I know (and context and my kn=
owledge of<br>
&gt; &gt; Latin root words.)=C2=A0 I can&#39;t promise I&#39;ll respond in =
French, but I think it<br>
&gt; &gt; could be a bit of fun.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; And a handful more questions, to keep things going:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Do you have any &quot;guilty pleasures?&quot;=C2=A0 Things you fe=
el a little ashamed of<br>
&gt; &gt; liking, but like anyway.=C2=A0 I promise I won&#39;t judge you, c=
ool people get a<br>
&gt; &gt; pass from my harsh judgement even if they like things I think are=
 silly.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; What are the little things that make you happy every time they ha=
ppen?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; What online presence do you have, other than facebook and e-mail?=
=C2=A0 What<br>
&gt; &gt; communities are popular with French teenagers?=C2=A0 I think they=
&#39;ll probably be<br>
&gt; &gt; similar to the big ones over here, but I&#39;m curious to see.<br=
>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Does anything scare you?=C2=A0 Either in the &quot;Ah! A spider!&=
quot; sense or in the<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Ah! A job where I&#39;m unsatisfied and no opportunity to g=
et out of it!&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; sense.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Finally, are there things that really drive you?=C2=A0 Like, a re=
ason to get out<br>
&gt; &gt; of bed in the morning (aside from alarm clocks and places to be.)=
<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Love,<br>
&gt; &gt; John<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; P.S.=C2=A0 Ah, jeez, these always spiral into really long letters=
.=C2=A0 I&#39;m sorry<br>
&gt; &gt; about that.=C2=A0 I just always feel like I have a lot to say.=C2=
=A0 Also, sorry if<br>
&gt; &gt; the questions about language are a bit much.=C2=A0 There&#39;s ju=
st a lot I find<br>
&gt; &gt; interesting about the idea of someone who&#39;s properly bilingua=
l (or<br>
&gt; &gt; trilingual, I guess, depending on how well the French education s=
ystem is<br>
&gt; &gt; doing on your third language.)<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Getting alcohol in France is as easy as buying bread. Seriou=

&gt; &gt; walk<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Into a supermarket and ask for alcohol, and unless you look =
like a<br>
&gt; &gt; twelve-year-old,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They usually won&#39;t ask for your ID.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Otherwise you can just walk into a bar and ask for whatever =
you want,<br>
&gt; &gt; not once<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have I seen someone getting their ID checked in a bar.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My opinion on the effects of alcohol? I guess it can be fun =
if you&#39;re<br>
&gt; &gt; kind of shy<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And need a nudge to loosen up or if you like the state it pu=
ts you in<br>
&gt; &gt; (which depends<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; On the person, in my case, it just makes me laugh hysterical=
ly at<br>
&gt; &gt; everything<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And say stupid things). But of course you need to drink with=
 moderation<br>
&gt; &gt; otherwise<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The effects are dreadful.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s an awesome story! Your parents must have found it=
 pretty damn<br>
&gt; &gt; funny.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well I have some stories about fighting for bathrooms in res=
taurants, at<br>
&gt; &gt; other people&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Houses, or during stomach flue epidemics (we catch it every =
time, and<br>
&gt; &gt; with five people<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And only two bathrooms in the house, it gets complicated ver=
y quickly),<br>
&gt; &gt; but they&#39;re best<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Told in person.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But just as an example of my family&#39;s comfortableness wi=
th the subject,<br>
&gt; &gt; I was talking<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; With Baz on the phone a couple of hours ago, he&#39;s in the=
 mountain with<br>
&gt; &gt; my grandparents,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My dad and some of my cousins and he was telling me he was s=
ick, and I<br>
&gt; &gt; asked how so<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And he just started matter of factly describing the color, s=
hape,<br>
&gt; &gt; consistency and even smell<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of his bowel movements. I guess it&#39;s a little gross, but=
 damn, does that<br>
&gt; &gt; kid make me laugh.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, things I dislike about my country:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of its people&#39;s snotty attitude, the racism, the te=
aching system,<br>
&gt; &gt; the way people<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Think France is by far superior to every other country, some=
 of the<br>
&gt; &gt; politicians.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And the things I like about it:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some landscapes, the rudeness (strangely I found myself miss=
ing it while<br>
&gt; &gt; I was in England),<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The healthcare, the train system, some of the food, the rich=
ness of its<br>
&gt; &gt; history, its proximity<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To all the countries surrounding it, the strikes.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I somewhat care about fashion, in the way I have to think ab=
out what I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; wearing when<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I go out and can&#39;t just throw on the first thing I find =
(unless it looks<br>
&gt; &gt; good). I don&#39;t really<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have a defined style though, I just wear things I think are =
pretty and<br>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t really think<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; About what style it is.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if French people really dress differently t=
han in the US, I<br>
&gt; &gt; guess it depends<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; On where in France and where in the US you are comparing.<br=
>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I like people who are kind, smart (not necessarily school sm=
art, I just<br>
&gt; &gt; enjoy interesting<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Conversations), who have the same sense of humor as me (a li=
ttle<br>
&gt; &gt; sarcastic, childish,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dark, or goofy, it depends on my mood). I like people who do=
n&#39;t take<br>
&gt; &gt; themselves too<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously. I have a thing for musicians, but don&#39;t exclu=
de those who<br>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t play music.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I like finding people who are passionate about the same movi=
es, books or<br>
&gt; &gt; musicians<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As me. I generally think it&#39;s really cute when someone i=
s passionate<br>
&gt; &gt; about something,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A sport, a hobby..., as long as it&#39;s something I like. I=
 like people who<br>
&gt; &gt; have opinions and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stand by them. I like people who are respectful (of the envi=
ronment, of<br>
&gt; &gt; women mostly).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m attracted by nice smiles, intelligent eyes, nice han=
ds, broad<br>
&gt; &gt; shoulders, and,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I might as well admit it, cute butts (who isn&#39;t?). I als=
o like the kind<br>
&gt; &gt; of tall, skinny, sometimes<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nerdy, cute-but-he-doesn&#39;t- know-it type of boy.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But I find physical traits are less important than the perso=
n&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; personality if I&#39;m looking for something long term.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No I do not care about watching or playing sport either. I d=
o like<br>
&gt; &gt; sports cars though<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (My dad&#39;s influence I think) but I don&#39;t know much a=
bout them.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No I do not see myself staying in N=C3=AEmes, at least not f=
or my studies<br>
&gt; &gt; (the university is a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit of a joke) I prefer imagining myself in a bigger city. I=

&gt; &gt; where I&#39;d like to<br>

 I think<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll just have<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To go where the wind takes me when the time comes.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;ll ask you the same questions, plus since it&#=

&gt; &gt; topic, what are the<br>

&gt; &gt; I do<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with new albums.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll pick a song, listen to i=
t repeatedly, and then do<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the same thing for the rest of the tracks in the album b=
efore I start to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; listen to it as a whole.=C2=A0 Sometimes.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I looked up Keiko Abe, and while I don&#39;t know much a=
bout marimba, I<br>
&gt; &gt; think I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can safely say her technique is amazing.=C2=A0 Some peop=
le are really<br>
&gt; &gt; incredible<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with their instrument.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In his defense, Baz is right that red dragons are cool a=
nd green dragons<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are obviously far inferior.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t agree that=
 red dragons are cooler<br>
&gt; &gt; than<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; blue dragons, though, and I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re s=
upposed to bite girls&#39;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; butts.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Emmanuel must have been pleased that his son &quot;did n=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My only decent story I can think of now (I feel like I a=
lso must have<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; entertaining ones with friends, but they elude me) is th=
e time I led an<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; escape from preschool.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been told that, when I was three or so years ol=
d, I organized a<br>
&gt; &gt; whole<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; class escape during my preschool.=C2=A0 For a three-year=
-old, it was<br>
&gt; &gt; successful,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; since I was able to get all the kids to follow me out to=
 the road<br>
&gt; &gt; before we<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; got caught.=C2=A0 I really wish I remembered this happen=
ing, because it<br>
&gt; &gt; sounds<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; really funny.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I think my favourite dish in London was this Indian =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t remember its name but it was some kind o=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sauce.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I also got to eat bacon (we don&#39;t have any here)=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thankfully N=C3=AEmes isn&#39;t a very rainy place s=
o at least we don&#39;t have to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; endure hot and humid weather (I think that&#39;s my =
least favourite)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The Black Keys concert was great, even if I prefer t=
heir older albums,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I still appreciate their new stuff, and they put on =
a great show.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No, we don&#39;t really go on dates, sometimes a cou=
ple will go see a movie<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; but we (at least not teenagers) don&#39;t go to coff=

&gt; &gt; if<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; we do, we don&#39;t consider it a date. Matter of fa=

&gt; &gt; of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the date doesn&#39;t really exist.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; People kiss or hold hands at school or at parties.<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not really into public displays of affection=
 so the whole<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; making out with your boyfriend/girlfriend in front o=
f everybody makes<br>
&gt; &gt; me<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a little uncomfortable.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Your underwear story is really funny!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s see, drinks that I hate... I don&#39;t lik=
e green tea, to me it just<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tastes<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; like warm water with a gross minty taste. I hate dri=
nking strong<br>
&gt; &gt; alcohols<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; without juice or soda or whatever makes them a cockt=

&gt; &gt; vodka,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; whiskey, martini... I don&#39;t understand why one=
=C2=A0 would drink such a<br>
&gt; &gt; drink on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; its own.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And sometimes, even inside a cocktail it&#39;s disgu=
sting, the taste of<br>
&gt; &gt; alcohol<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; overrated.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There are also some really nasty wines, including a =
grapefruit one, I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; thought<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it was going to make me sick.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve never watched any anime, but I don&#39;t kn=
ow why I wouldn&#39;t like it,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; so I guess I should get to it sooner or latter!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes I associate songs to certain times of my life. S=
ometimes I get sad<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for no particular reason, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m =
depressed or anything, but<br>
&gt; &gt; it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; can<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; last from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. Any=
way, during those<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; periods of time, I usually pick a song and spend mos=
t of my free<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; time listening to it. So then a couple of months aft=
er I listen to the<br>
&gt; &gt; song<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and it makes me think of that time. It can ruin a so=
ng for me, but it<br>
&gt; &gt; can<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; also make me appreciate not feeling crappy anymore.<=
br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But I also have a tendency to excessively listen to =
songs I discover<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; if ever I like them a lot, and if the time I listen =
to them is also a<br>
&gt; &gt; time<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; when<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; something memorable happens, thinking of the time ma=
kes me think of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the song and vice-versa.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I kind of look up to this Japanese marimba player, K=
eiko Abe. Her<br>
&gt; &gt; music can<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a little strange sometimes but she revolutionized th=
e way we play<br>
&gt; &gt; marimba,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; her technique is rather amazing. Apparently she can =
play with six<br>
&gt; &gt; sticks<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (three in each hand).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I have some cool stories, most of them involve eithe=
r Baz, Louise or<br>
&gt; &gt; bodily<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; functions (I&#39;m starting to realize that not all =
families are as amused<br>
&gt; &gt; as<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mine by<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the smells, amongst other things, that can emanate f=
rom various regions<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the human body).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So anyway, I have two kindergarten stories about Baz=
 that you might<br>
&gt; &gt; find<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; entertaining. I wasn&#39;t present when they occurre=
d, but they have been<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; told and retold over the years, so I know them by he=
art.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A little background for the first one: when he was t=
hree, Basile was<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; convinced that he was a dragon. The king of the red =
dragons to be<br>
&gt; &gt; precise<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (for he claimed that the other dragons, the blue and=
 green ones, were<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; utter garbage and paled in comparison to his superio=
rity). I think that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; simple fact is funny enough, but there is more to th=
is story.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One day, my mom went to pick Baz up at the end of th=
e day, and,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; like everyday, she asked the teacher if the day had =
gone well. The<br>
&gt; &gt; teacher<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; said it had, except for one detail: during the after=
noon, while the<br>
&gt; &gt; other<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; children were playing, Basile, acting like a dragon,=
 had come up behind<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; her and bitten her right on the butt. He hadn&#39;t =
hurt her or anything,<br>
&gt; &gt; but he<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; had confirmed our suspicion that he was a strange ch=
ild.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Today, he says the story is a lie, but we know the t=
ruth.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Now for the other story:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My father works late everyday, so he wasn&#39;t usua=
lly the one to pick us<br>
&gt; &gt; up<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from school, but once he had a day off, so he took c=
are of going to get<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; my brother. He went inside the school, found his cla=
ssroom, and went<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to speak to the teacher. He told her he was here to =
pick up his son,<br>
&gt; &gt; Basile.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This teacher had never seen my father before, and we=
nt to ask Baz if he<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; knew this man that was here to pick him up. My broth=
er who was playing<br>
&gt; &gt; with<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a friend looked up, looked at my dad, looked back at=
 his teacher and<br>
&gt; &gt; told<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; her that no, he did not know that man.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My dad had to go around the school and find one of m=
y old teachers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; who recognized him so they were finally able to leav=
e and come home.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Family members are source of many amusing anecdotes,=
 I must have<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; funny stories with my friends, but none seem to come=
 to my mind at this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; instant. Have you got any other cool stories?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s fine you&#39;re taking time to reply, I=
 would much rather you take<br>
&gt; &gt; your<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time than try to rush correspondence.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s good to hear London went well.=C2=A0 Si=
nce you enjoyed the food so<br>
&gt; &gt; much, I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to ask what your favorite dish was while yo=
u were there.=C2=A0 It&#39;s a<br>
&gt; &gt; shame<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; N=C3=AEmes is so hot, It&#39;s pretty damn hot i=
n columbus most days too.<br>
&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been getting a lot more rain than is usual durin=
g the summer, but it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still more humid than any human should have to d=
eal with.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 38=C2=B0C is crazy hot, though.=C2=A0 Hope it&#3=
9;s not that warm *and* humid.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course I have your back, that&#39;s what cous=
ins are for.=C2=A0 Now, the<br>
&gt; &gt; story of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my previous relationship:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For some background, the girl I was dating at th=
e time seemed to me<br>
&gt; &gt; to be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremely straightforward and honest.=C2=A0 When=
 I first started dating<br>
&gt; &gt; her, she<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was a part of my main group of friends.=C2=A0 Th=
is was my first mistake.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The relationship was fun, and I certainly don&#3=
9;t regret getting<br>
&gt; &gt; involved<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with her.=C2=A0 We shared an awful lot of intere=
sts, and she was very<br>
&gt; &gt; laidback.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Honestly, the whole thing was super cool and if =
it hadn&#39;t ended on<br>
&gt; &gt; such a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bad note I would still be her friend.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, so the mistake I had made was over-inves=
ting emotionally in<br>
&gt; &gt; one<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group of friends (a mistake I will absolutely no=
t make again) and it<br>
&gt; &gt; turned<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out a couple of the people in the group were not=
 the hugest fans of<br>
&gt; &gt; me and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were just &quot;being polite.&quot;=C2=A0 I was =
coming to this conclusion toward the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; latter<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half of last Summer.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So the school year started back up, and I was ge=
tting weird vibes<br>
&gt; &gt; from my<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; girlfriend.=C2=A0 I couldn&#39;t figure out exac=
tly what was up.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One night, she texts me and seems very upset, sa=
ying how she doesn&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; want<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to lose a guy like me and how I&#39;ve been a gr=
eat boyfriend and how<br>
&gt; &gt; she&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been going through a lot of feelings on the subj=
ect.=C2=A0 I try to be<br>
&gt; &gt; helpful<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through it, but still don&#39;t really get what&=
#39;s happening.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Two days later, she dumps me over the phone.=C2=
=A0 No explanation.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, I&#39;m obviously not telling you the entir=
e story, as I don&#39;t think<br>
&gt; &gt; you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want a novel&#39;s worth of exposition on the re=
asons I think it<br>
&gt; &gt; happened.=C2=A0 At<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the time I was kind of clueless, but I have sinc=
e reasoned out<br>
&gt; &gt; exactly what<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; led to the events that occurred.=C2=A0 At the ti=
me, I was very angry, but<br>
&gt; &gt; in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; retrospect I don&#39;t begrudge her at all.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, this had a negative effect on my interac=
tions with what, up<br>
&gt; &gt; to that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point, had been a very major group of friends in=
 my life.=C2=A0 To say<br>
&gt; &gt; that I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had a bad couple of months would be an understat=
ement, but it taught<br>
&gt; &gt; me a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot about what not to do when it comes to pickin=
g friends.=C2=A0 I have<br>
&gt; &gt; since<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; found better friends, and I&#39;m in a pretty go=
od place now emotionally.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, that was a rambling description of an unin=

&gt; &gt; Back to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the scheduled e-mail topics.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Ar=C3=A8nes de N=C3=AEmes are really cool.=
=C2=A0 Roman architecture in Columbus<br>
&gt; &gt; is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; limited to a couple arches and columns downtown,=
 so it&#39;s really cool<br>
&gt; &gt; that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; N=C3=AEmes has a full-blown Roman amphitheatre.=
=C2=A0 How was the Black Keys<br>
&gt; &gt; concert?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I like their work, though I feel they were bette=
r on older albums<br>
&gt; &gt; before<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they got more instrumentation and got overproduc=
ed.=C2=A0 That&#39;s just my<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opinion, though.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones are on the =
list of shows I&#39;ve<br>
&gt; &gt; been<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; told I need to watch and I haven&#39;t yet.=C2=

&gt; &gt; things<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about both series (serieses?=C2=A0 English is ha=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; haven&#39;t started on either.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What a punk Louise is, taking a good book to Str=
asbourg with her.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt; &gt; think<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve seen the movie, but it would have been =
quite some time ago that I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; watched it.=C2=A0 I ought to rewatch it, since I=
 enjoyed the movie quite a<br>
&gt; &gt; bit<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first time I watched it.=C2=A0 I haven&#39;t=
 seen Sherlock, but it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; another<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; series I&#39;ve been told I must watch.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as really bad songs, I suppose the worst =
one I&#39;ve heard<br>
&gt; &gt; recently<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have to be something by IceJJFish, but he&=
#39;s obviously not<br>
&gt; &gt; serious<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with his music:<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of the music I&#39;m really distasteful for=
 isn&#39;t especially<br>
&gt; &gt; terrible,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it&#39;s just bland.=C2=A0 Most of the stuff tha=
t gets incredibly popular<br>
&gt; &gt; around<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here falls into that category.=C2=A0 If I have t=
o hear &quot;California Girls&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; one<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more time I swear someone is going to die.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I like Thanksgiving, but I like Halloween more I=
 would say.=C2=A0 It&#39;s an<br>
&gt; &gt; excuse<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for people to dress up and eat candy, which is r=
eally all you need to<br>
&gt; &gt; get<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me on board with a holiday.=C2=A0 Christmas is f=
un too, but the strongly<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religious get noisy around that time of year her=
e.=C2=A0 Actually, they&#39;re<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always noisy.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t have a problem w=
ith religion, until people try<br>
&gt; &gt; to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pass it into law or force it on me.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, back on topic.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t stand cheese, regardless of what it&=
#39;s on, since I can&#39;t have<br>
&gt; &gt; milk.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s technically not lactose intolerance, bu=
t the actual distinction<br>
&gt; &gt; is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kind of pointless to make and boring.=C2=A0 As a=
 result, I don&#39;t really<br>
&gt; &gt; enjoy<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; buttery, creamy type food.=C2=A0 It seems like t=
here&#39;s this idea that<br>
&gt; &gt; putting<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; butter or cheese on something will make it tasti=
er, when in reality<br>
&gt; &gt; all it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does is ruin it.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; People don&#39;t go on dates in France?=C2=A0 Wh=
en else are you supposed to<br>
&gt; &gt; hold<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hands with your significant other, or kiss them?=
=C2=A0 I don&#39;t really have<br>
&gt; &gt; a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; funny date story, but I do have a funny story in=
volving someone I was<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dating at the time.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was coming home from hanging out with some fri=
ends of mine, and my<br>
&gt; &gt; mother<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is furious.=C2=A0 She doesn&#39;t say why, but I=
 can tell she&#39;s beyond livid.<br>
&gt; &gt; I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finally get from her why she&#39;s mad, and she =
accuses me of having sex<br>
&gt; &gt; with<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my girlfriend in my parents&#39; bed.=C2=A0 I ha=
dn&#39;t had sex with this girl at<br>
&gt; &gt; all,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let alone in my parents&#39; bed, so you can und=
erstand why I would be<br>
&gt; &gt; shocked<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and confused.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I respond by asking &quot;Why the hell would I d=
o that, and why would you<br>
&gt; &gt; think<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would do that?&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She said back to me &quot;Well, I found women&#3=
9;s underwear in my bed, and<br>
&gt; &gt; they&#39;re<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definitely not my underwear.&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We argue back and forth for a while, because ear=
lier in the weekend I<br>
&gt; &gt; had<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done laundry and there was a pair of underwear a=
t the bottom of my<br>
&gt; &gt; basket<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that I had casually assumed were my mothers and =
I set them on her<br>
&gt; &gt; bed.=C2=A0 She<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ends up yelling at me to go look at the underwea=
r, and about how<br>
&gt; &gt; obviously<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they couldn&#39;t have been her underwear.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, I don&#39;t know how most people would reac=
t to a strange pair of<br>
&gt; &gt; panties<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just sitting at the bottom of their laundry bask=
et, but I just<br>
&gt; &gt; thought &quot;I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know whose these are, and the only wom=
an living in this house<br>
&gt; &gt; is my<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mother.&quot;=C2=A0 In retrospect, they were def=
initely not her sort of<br>
&gt; &gt; underwear,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though in fairness my girlfriend of the time wou=
ldn&#39;t be caught<br>
&gt; &gt; wearing a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leopard-print thong either.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I go up, and on the band of the underwear is an =
orange cat hair.=C2=A0 At<br>
&gt; &gt; this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point, everything makes sense.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At the time, we had been letting my cousin do la=
undry at our place<br>
&gt; &gt; while<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she was getting on her feet.=C2=A0 She had just =
moved in from Maine, and<br>
&gt; &gt; she<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; owned an orange cat.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wish I had had a camera to take a picture of t=
he face my mom made<br>
&gt; &gt; when<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she realized I was telling the truth and she had=
 just yelled at me for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three hours at 9 in the morning for no reason.=
=C2=A0 That single moment<br>
&gt; &gt; may have<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been the biggest &quot;I told you so&quot; in my=
 whole life.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most of my actual dates have been really plain, =
like going to coffee<br>
&gt; &gt; shops<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or getting lunch or going to the movies.=C2=A0 T=
hey were fun, but not super<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entertaining stories.=C2=A0 I have one decent st=
ory but I should save that<br>
&gt; &gt; for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an e-mail where it&#39;s not already insanely lo=
ng with stories already.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as jokes go, I rely far more on timing an=
d delivery than<br>
&gt; &gt; actually<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remembering jokes.=C2=A0 I suffer from the same =
issue you do, and when I<br>
&gt; &gt; think a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; joke is funny enough to remember for a little wh=
ile it&#39;s usually only<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really funny to me.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lemaitre are a pretty important band to me, but =
more because of when<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; listened to them than the band themselves.=C2=A0=
 That song in particular,<br>
&gt; &gt; but<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their work in general, has helped me through som=
e rough patches.=C2=A0 I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; glad<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you enjoyed it.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, since we&#39;re asking least favorites, wh=
at drink(s) do you hate?<br>
&gt; &gt; For<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me, I don&#39;t like putting anything in coffee,=
 or trying to do anything<br>
&gt; &gt; fancy<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with it.=C2=A0 The only thing I think should be =
added to espresso is<br>
&gt; &gt; water, but<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would rather just drink any coffee straight.=
=C2=A0 I also really don&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; enjoy<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carrot juice.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you like any anime?=C2=A0 I have a thing for =
Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure.<br>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over-the-top and silly and has a lot of really m=
uscular men, but my<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite part about it is that the whole show do=
esn&#39;t take itself<br>
&gt; &gt; seriously<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at all.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any artists/albums/songs you associate=
 with a particular<br>
&gt; &gt; time in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your life or a specific feeling?=C2=A0 Lemaitre =
was an example I mentioned<br>
&gt; &gt; a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; couple paragraphs back, but if you point to any =
song I&#39;ve listened to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obsessively I probably associate it with a speci=
fic time in my life.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since you play percussion, are there any drummer=
s/percussionists you<br>
&gt; &gt; enjoy<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; especially or look up to?=C2=A0 I know as a guit=
arist I look up to Eric<br>
&gt; &gt; Clapton,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Steven Wilson, Steve Howe, and so many other mus=
icians.=C2=A0 As a<br>
&gt; &gt; vocalist, I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up to a lot of people (there are a lot of really=
 nice voices out<br>
&gt; &gt; there) but<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lately I&#39;ve been really into Dan Avidan&#39;=
s voice.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any cool stories?=C2=A0 (This one is open-ended,=
 since I don&#39;t know if my<br>
&gt; &gt; other<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; questions will generate as much dialogue as you =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; watching<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TV ever since. As expected, it was awesome, =

&gt; &gt; and I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to make fun of the British accent. The food =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for having my back!<br>

<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes I did have the Thai food when we were in=
 Columbus! It was so<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; delicious,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cost of a plane ticket is almost worth c=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Haha, the Ar=C3=A8nes de N=C3=AEmes really d=
o rock! Have you seen pictures of<br>
&gt; &gt; them?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#39;re right next to my high school, it=
&#39;s kind of wild, we can see<br>
&gt; &gt; them<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a few of the chemistry labs&#39; windows. I =
went to see a Black Keys<br>
&gt; &gt; concert<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last summer. N=C3=AEmes has some nice Roman =
architecture.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes you must absolutely get caught up on OIT=
NB! I also just finished<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sense8,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and it was rather good, I recommend it. I di=
d spend the first episode<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; asking myself<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what the hell was going on, but then I got a=
ddicted to it. At the<br>
&gt; &gt; moment<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m (re-)watching<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Walking Dead, it&#39;s great if you like=
 zombies. I really liked<br>
&gt; &gt; Hannibal<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too, the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannibalism thing is kind of gross, but I lo=
ve Mads Mikkelsen, one of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theleading actors.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you seen any of these shows? Have you w=
atched Game of Thrones? I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; haven&#39;t seen<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the fifth season yet, so no spoilers if you =
have!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I started reading the Hitchhiker&#39;s guide=
 to the galaxy, but then<br>
&gt; &gt; Louise<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; took it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with her to Strasbourg so I never got to fin=

&gt; &gt; Have you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seen<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the movie? It&#39;s with Martin Freeman, tha=
t guy seems to be playing in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at the moment. Ooh, speaking of him do you k=
now the BBC tv show<br>
&gt; &gt; Sherlock?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s with him and Benedict Cumberbatch, =
I love it! There aren&#39;t many<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; episodes,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but it is quality TV. Ok, I might have to st=

&gt; &gt; shows<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are right, I have no love for pop-countr=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Speaking of bad music, I recently heard two =
unbelievably bad songs,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;bitch better have my money&quot; and &=
quot;bad blood&quot;. it&#39;s kind of a negative<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; topic,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but what&#39;s the worst song you&#39;ve hea=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you like music, but do you like an ot=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paintings<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for example? Are there any painters that you=
 like?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I like Van Gogh, Monet also did quite a few =
beautiful paintings.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also like Salvador Dali, he looks like he =
was a fun guy, his work<br>
&gt; &gt; was<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a little weird sometimes, but that doesn&#39=

&gt; &gt; weird<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we don&#39;t have the day off and have to go=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of food do you hate? I personally =
hate cheese (except on<br>
&gt; &gt; pizza<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a few other things). You&#39;re lactose into=
lerant right? I also don&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; like<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zucchini, especially<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in soups. Otherwise, French people enjoy som=

&gt; &gt; that<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really appreciate (&quot;fromage de t=C3=AAt=

&gt; &gt; into<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s literally head ch=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; People don&#39;t really go on dates in Franc=
e, do you have any funny date<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stories?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or do you know any good jokes? I know every =
time I hear a good joke I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tell<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;oh yeah, that&#39;s a great joke, I sh=
ould try not forgetting this<br>
&gt; &gt; one!&quot;,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then I always do.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There goes my joke knowledge.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m going to Corsica (a French island=
 in the Mediterranean) from<br>
&gt; &gt; July<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 27th to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; August 11th and I might not have access to m=
y e-mail during that<br>
&gt; &gt; time,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really sorry,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if I ever have a chance I will write to you,=
 for I am also extremely<br>
&gt; &gt; glad<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we are corresponding,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I hope you don&#39;t think that I&#39;m =
not because of my response<br>
&gt; &gt; frequency.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This week though<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will be at home, so I&#39;ll respond quick=
er.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, and I listened to a couple of the songs =
you told me about, I<br>
&gt; &gt; really<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like them,<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Sophie,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you have fun in London, it sounds lik=
e it&#39;s going to be a<br>
&gt; &gt; blast.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always kind of wanted to travel without =
parents or adult-types, so<br>
&gt; &gt; by<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a friend.=C2=A0 It seems like a lot=
 of fun.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would never out anyone for any reason,=
 so your relationship<br>
&gt; &gt; status is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; safe<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with me.=C2=A0 I wouldn&#39;t wish that =
sort of treatment on my enemies.=C2=A0 If<br>
&gt; &gt; I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a relationship with a guy (and it&#39=
;s not too unlikely a thing<br>
&gt; &gt; that it<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen) I certainly wouldn&#39;t want an=
yone to know anything I didn&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; tell<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry about the fact the relationship mi=
ght not last, though.=C2=A0 My<br>
&gt; &gt; last<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship was about 3 or 4 months, an=
d it didn&#39;t end on the best<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terms.=C2=A0 I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could tell the story, but it&#39;s basic=
ally school drama from 7 months<br>
&gt; &gt; or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ago<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so I don&#39;t know how much you really =
care to hear of that.=C2=A0 Best of<br>
&gt; &gt; luck,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless of what ends up happening.<br=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thai food in general is great.=C2=A0 I d=
on&#39;t know if you had it while you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but there&#39;s a fantastic Thai place r=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; couple<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes&#39; walk.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve heard childbirth, even if it go=

&gt; &gt; is not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that fun.=C2=A0 Neither is pregnancy.=C2=
=A0 It&#39;s probably a good idea to avoid<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do with having kids until later in life,=
 since kids cost a lot of<br>
&gt; &gt; money<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and time<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and they destroy your sleep schedule and=
 they cry a lot.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really like young kids too m=
uch, as a concept.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rousseau was pretty cool.=C2=A0 I recent=
ly actually read about someone<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inspirational.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Admiral Grace Hopper was a pioneer in co=
mputer science and did work<br>
&gt; &gt; with<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the US<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Navy.=C2=A0 She was pretty cool and once=
 said &quot;The most dangerous phrase<br>
&gt; &gt; in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; language is, &#39;We&#39;ve always done =
it this way.&#39;&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Red Hot Chili Peppers are a great band.=
=C2=A0 Also, I won&#39;t make fun of<br>
&gt; &gt; you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liking Earth, Wind, and Fire.=C2=A0 I li=
ke a few of their songs.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh yeah also OITNB is a pretty cool show=
 and I need to get caught<br>
&gt; &gt; up on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for answering my own questions, here =
they are again (for my<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; convenience)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Favorite album, band, song, weather,=
 candy, drink (non-alcoholic, I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assume,)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; book, movie, TV show?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Album: current heavy rotation is Justice=
&#39;s second live album,<br>
&gt; &gt; Access All<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arenas<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (recorded at the Arena of N=C3=AEmes, co=
incidentally) but my favorite all<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; album<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is much more contested.=C2=A0 Daft Punk&=
#39;s Alive 2007 is possible, as is<br>
&gt; &gt; Human<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All.=C2=A0 Also maybe Rush&#39;s 2112.=
=C2=A0 Shit, I don&#39;t know.=C2=A0 Band would have<br>
&gt; &gt; to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Daft<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Punk (though props to Lemaitre.)=C2=A0 S=
ong is also tricky, I guess<br>
&gt; &gt; current<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be something like Civilization by =
Justice, and all-time would<br>
&gt; &gt; be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cut<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Black by Lemaitre?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Weather would be overcast and cool enoug=
h for a light jacket or<br>
&gt; &gt; maybe<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overcast<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and cold (I have strange taste.)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Candy would be probably cherry sours or =
paydays.=C2=A0 Drink would be<br>
&gt; &gt; lemon<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seltzer,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or plain seltzer.=C2=A0 Pellegrino isn&#=
39;t bad, especially in a glass<br>
&gt; &gt; bottle.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drinking out of a glass bottle.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Book is tough because I don&#39;t read e=
nough, but I have a thing for A<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Clockwork<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Orange and the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide se=
ries.=C2=A0 Movie I guess would be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something by<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; studio Ghibli, maybe Nausicaa of the Val=
ley of the Wind.=C2=A0 That<br>
&gt; &gt; movie was<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; great.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TV show would probably be some anime lik=
e Jojo&#39;s Bizarre adventure.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you own any computers?=C2=A0 What=

&gt; &gt; learning a<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; written a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; couple of chord progressions and lines o=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m also pretty easy to get excited =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey John,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really love traveling, and have be=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Either with my family or on school t=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Obviously), Spain on several occasi=
ons (going to Barcelona is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literally<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A three hour drive, and one of my un=

&gt; &gt; of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The country), Ireland, and Germany t=
wice with school. I&#39;m also<br>
&gt; &gt; going<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To London next week with my best fri=
end whose name is Emma and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who has been my partner in crime for=
 about 13 years. We&#39;re going<br>
&gt; &gt; there<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alone, so I think it&#39;ll be quite=
 fun.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am currently in a relationship wit=
h a girl, though you are the<br>
&gt; &gt; only<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; family<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Member to know this, so I&#39;m coun=
ting on your discretion. Today is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually our<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fourth month anniversary, but to be =
honest I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; going<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Much longer, which is sad. I&#39;ve =
also been with boys, but this is<br>
&gt; &gt; the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Real relationship I&#39;ve ever had.=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think my favorite color at the mom=
ent red, And my favorite food<br>
&gt; &gt; is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thai<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; noodles, but it is extremely hard to=
 find decent ones in France.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really have any family p=
rojects, I did try to convince my<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; family<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To move to New Zealand, but they wer=
en&#39;t very enthusiastic,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I guess I&#39;ll just have to may=
be do it on my own one day.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The thought of having kids (in a few=
 years) was rather appealing<br>
&gt; &gt; to me<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Until Louise, who, as you must know =
it, studies biology, told me<br>
&gt; &gt; in a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Detailed manner about childbirth and=
 breastfeeding and other shit,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So now I&#39;m contemplating adoptio=
n, or just not having kids. But<br>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something I really worry about, sinc=
e if it must happen, it will<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in at<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Least ten years.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having always lived in a city, even =
though I enjoy the country<br>
&gt; &gt; side,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe I would have a very hard t=
ime trying to live anywhere<br>
&gt; &gt; but in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A city.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My favorite subject depends as much =
on the teacher as on the<br>
&gt; &gt; subject<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So this year I think my favorite sub=
jects were math and physics.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are some philosophers who insp=
ire me, like Jean Jacques<br>
&gt; &gt; Rousseau<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who wrote texts against slavery, but=
 also women&#39;s rights activists.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think my favorite album is either =
The head on the door (by the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cure) or<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark side of the mo=
on. I don&#39;t really have a favorite<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; band,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many bands that I enjoy, like Phoeni=
x, Daft Punk, Metronomy, the<br>
&gt; &gt; Red<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hot<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chili Peppers, Belle and Sebastian (=
hippie music, my mom would<br>
&gt; &gt; say),<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and others. My favorite song changes=
 all the time, but at the<br>
&gt; &gt; moment<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it&#39;s<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Get down on it by Earth Wind and Fir=
e (you are authorized to make<br>
&gt; &gt; fun<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of me).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My favorite candy is peanuts m&amp;m=
&#39;s, my favorite drink is Schweppes.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I love rainstorms, my favorite book =
is the Spellman Files by Lisa<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lutz,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t have a favorite movie an=
d my favorite TV show is 30 rock<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or Orange is the new black.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes I own a computer, it&#39;s a pie=
ce of shit dell laptop (sorry I<br>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tell you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More about it) that is given to ever=

&gt; &gt; part<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Program that is supposed to enable p=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To be able to work on one (but every=
one just ends up watching<br>
&gt; &gt; movies<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With theirs). We also have one &quot=
;house computer&quot; and an Asus laptop.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can get rather excited about music=
, and I don&#39;t have many<br>
&gt; &gt; musician<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Friends, so they always look at me l=
ike I&#39;m the biggest nerd when I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; start<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Talking about this rhythm that I lea=
rned or when I try telling them<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I found funny during a music class b=
ut that they don&#39;t understand.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess my biggest short time goal i=
s getting good grades at the<br>
&gt; &gt; bac<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And finding and getting accepted at =
a good university. It&#39;s not<br>
&gt; &gt; very<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exciting,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that&#39;s it.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve never written any fiction, =
I have thought about it a couple of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But have always lacked inspiration.<=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve never composed any music ei=
ther, but it would be so much fun<br>
&gt; &gt; if<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I ever got to it!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I haven&#39;t got any ideas for new =
questions, but I&#39;d like to know the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answers<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think =

&gt; &gt; to<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I play s=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and other xylophone<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Resembli=

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is=
 bigger than the xylophone, and not made of the same<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bigger o=

&gt; &gt; others.<br>
