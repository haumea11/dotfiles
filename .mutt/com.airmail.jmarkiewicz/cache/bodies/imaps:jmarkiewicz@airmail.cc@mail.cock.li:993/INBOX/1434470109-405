Hey Mr. Medley,

Lately I've started to consider a major in vocal music, and I was
wondering if you had any advice or information.  Colleges, things to
do, and if I can be good enough to get in in time.  Also, what sort of
work can be gotten with a degree in vocal music?

To simplify: what should and shouldn't I be worried about if I want to
major in vocal music?

I'm not sure yet whether this is the path I want to take, but I think
it's very likely to be one I would enjoy, and if I do decide to do it
I'd be willing to commit time and effort as necessary to get into a
program.

Best Wishes,
John Markiewicz
