Ah, well I love movies.  I also have a thing for pulp fiction, and
tarantino's films in general.  They're pretty violent but some of them are
really good.  I don't know Studio Ghibli, I'll check it out.  We have so
many movies here.  I always love Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings.
Classics...
For TV shows, I really like 30 rock, scrubs, Game of thrones, chuck.  How I
met your mother and Big bang theory are pretty good too. It's so addictive
though!  What about you?
Now books, I'm reading 'He named me Malala".  I also loved the Hitchhiker's
guide, I had like a little obsession with douglas adams and read all his
books.  a couple years ago.  I love reading.
Yeah, for schools in France, it's a little complicated.  You need to do a
two year program after high school (after the BAC), called pr=C3=A9pa
(litterally, preparation) before you can get into a school.  And after that
pr=C3=A9pa, which is very hard and not fun, a lot of people don't get in.  =
It's
a very frustrating and depressing system.  I chose university, but it's not
very well seen here.  So I don't recommend France, not for university.
Maybe Scotland, England, Germany, they might be better.  But come to France
on vacation!  We'd love to have you.  It's a pretty cool country, I just
think they could do better on the education front.
What are your plans for the summer?  How was the reunion and the spreading
of the ashes?  I really wish we were there.
love,
Louise

&gt;&gt; sleeping.=C2=A0 But it&#39;s so hot here there&#39;s not much else=
 to do. It<br>
&gt;&gt; gets to more than 30=C2=B0C which is about 90=C2=B0F I think.=C2=
=A0 You truly<br>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t do much. Life has been good.=C2=A0 I moved to Strasbourg=
 last<br>
&gt;&gt; August, for college. It&#39;s a really beautiful city.=C2=A0 It&#3=
9;s like 15<br>
&gt;&gt; minutes away from Germany. If you come to France, you can come<br>
&gt;&gt; crash on my couch.=C2=A0 I&#39;m back in N=C3=AEmes for the summer=
, it&#39;s pretty<br>
&gt;&gt; strange being back here. You&#39;re a senior next year, right?=C2=
=A0 Are you<br>
&gt;&gt; thinking of colleges yet? Love, Louise<br>

&gt;&gt; Hey Louise,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; It really has been so long.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve been doing well lately.=
<br>
&gt; Being on<br>
&gt;&gt; holiday really gives me time to sleep, which is something I<br>
&gt; need to<br>
&gt;&gt; catch up on after the school year.=C2=A0 It almost could be said<b=
r>
&gt; I&#39;m sleeping<br>
&gt;&gt; too much, though that would not be my claim.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Right now I am in Maine.=C2=A0 Much of the family is here, and<br>
&gt; losing games<br>
&gt;&gt; of gin to me.=C2=A0 Later today we&#39;re going off to scatter the=
<br>
&gt; ashes, and<br>
&gt;&gt; after that it&#39;s basically that we&#39;re all stuck in Maine fo=
r a<br>
&gt; while.<br>
&gt;&gt; Most of the parents are nostalgic, but in my opinion the only<br>
&gt; redeeming<br>
&gt;&gt; aspect of this place is the nature=E2=80=94the forests and the riv=
ers<br>
&gt; and such.<br>
&gt;&gt; Also, our house is pretty big, but that&#39;s mostly just to deal<=
br>
&gt; with how<br>
&gt;&gt; many people are staying here.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; As far as what I&#39;ve been up to lately, I&#39;ve been doing a g=
ood<br>
&gt; bit of<br>
&gt;&gt; work with computers.=C2=A0 Hopefully soon I&#39;ll have work repai=
ring<br>
&gt; computers<br>
&gt;&gt; instead of selling movie tickets, and if my talk gets accepted<br>
&gt; I&#39;ll be<br>
&gt;&gt; speaking at a conference later this summer (as I was writing this<=
br>
&gt;&gt; e-mail, I was informed in another e-mail that my talk would<br>
&gt; probably not<br>
&gt;&gt; make it on to the schedule, but I have plenty of other things<br>
&gt; to attend<br>
&gt;&gt; to anyway.)=C2=A0 That would be pretty cool.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; How has life been for you?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Take care, John<br>
