Hello Choir Families,
This year we have been offered the opportunity to perform at State Auto's
Nativity Event. The date is Friday, Dec. 18th at 7pm. This is the last day
of school and I don't know how many families are immediately leaving for
break.
I wanted to take a read on the interest level for this event to make sure
that we have a sizeable choir to perform.

Students would be performing under a tent with risers and microphones. They
will not wear their uniforms, but should dress warmly because we perform
outside like we've done at the Zoo Lights in the past.
The State Auto Building is located downtown at 518 East Broad St. Parking
is available as well as restrooms for this Nativity event.

Please let me know if your child is unable to perform on this day so I know
about how many to expect so I make decisions regarding our performance,
*Christen Joyce*

*Choral Director*

*Bishop Watterson High School*
